## Architecture Overview

### Core Application Structure

This is a React + TypeScript + Vite application for creating and managing Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game (BFRPG) characters and game sessions. The app uses:

- **React 19** with functional components and hooks
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **TailwindCSS v4** for styling with design tokens
- **Firebase** for authentication and Firestore database
- **Vite** for build tooling with optimized chunk splitting
- **Husky** for pre-commit hooks (linting and building)

### Key Architecture Patterns

#### Data Flow

The application supports both character creation and game management with persistent state:

**Character Creation Flow:**
- `CharGen.tsx` orchestrates the multi-step character creation wizard
- Each step is a separate component in `src/components/character/creation/`
- Character data is stored in localStorage during creation and synced to Firebase when authenticated
- All character state uses the `Character` interface from `src/types/character.ts`

**Game Management Flow:**
- `GameGen.tsx` and `GameSheet.tsx` handle game session creation and management
- Game data uses the `Game` interface from `src/types/game.ts`
- Games can include players (linked to characters) and combatants for encounters

#### State Management

- **Local State**: React hooks (`useState`, `useLocalStorage` custom hook)
- **Global State**: Custom hooks for auth (`useAuth`) and characters (`useCharacters`)
- **Persistence**: localStorage for draft characters, Firebase Firestore for saved characters
- **Validation**: Cascade validation system that automatically updates dependent fields

#### Component Organization

**UI Components (Design System):**
- `src/components/ui/design-system/` - Core design system components (Card, Typography, Badge)
- `src/components/ui/inputs/` - Form inputs (Button, Select, TextInput, NumberInput, etc.)
- `src/components/ui/feedback/` - User feedback (Modal, Notification, Tooltip, LoadingState, etc.)
- `src/components/ui/display/` - Data display (StatCard, ItemGrid, Stepper, etc.)
- `src/components/ui/layout/` - Layout components (Accordion, Tabs, PageWrapper, etc.)
- `src/components/ui/dice/` - Dice rolling components

**Feature Components:**
- `src/components/character/creation/` - Character creation wizard steps
- `src/components/character/management/` - Character list and management
- `src/components/character/sheet/` - Character sheet display and editing
- `src/components/character/shared/` - Shared character components (CantripSelector, etc.)
- `src/components/game/management/` - Game creation and listing
- `src/components/game/sheet/` - Game session management
- `src/components/pages/` - Top-level page components
- `src/components/auth/` - Authentication-related components

#### Services Layer

- `src/services/characters.ts` - Firebase character CRUD operations
- `src/services/games.ts` - Firebase game session CRUD operations
- `src/services/auth.ts` - Firebase authentication wrapper
- `src/services/characterValidation.ts` - Character validation logic
- `src/services/characterMigration.ts` - Data migration for character schema changes
- `src/services/dataLoader.ts` - Preloading critical game data

### Game Data System

Game data (races, classes, equipment, spells, cantrips) is stored as TypeScript modules and JSON files in `src/data/`:

**Structured Data:**
- `src/data/races/` - Each race as a separate .ts file with type-safe data (human, elf, dwarf, halfling, gnome, plus supplemental races)
- `src/data/classes/` - Each class as a separate .ts file (fighter, cleric, magic-user, thief, plus supplemental classes like paladin, ranger, barbarian, etc.)
- `src/data/equipment.json` - Weapons, armor, and gear with detailed properties
- `src/data/spells.json` - Spell database with level requirements per class
- `src/data/cantrips.json` - 0-level spells for applicable classes

**Content Flags:**
- Core BFRPG content vs supplemental material clearly marked
- Version tracking for data compatibility

### Firebase Integration

**Authentication:** Email/password authentication

**Firestore Database Structure:**
- Characters: `/users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}`
- Games: `/users/{userId}/games/{gameId}`
- Character migration system handles schema evolution
- Game sessions can reference characters across users

### Accessibility Features

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Skip links and semantic HTML structure

### Bundle Optimization

Vite configuration includes manual chunk splitting:

- Separate chunks for React, Firebase, router, and game data
- Path aliases configured for clean imports (`@/components`, `@/types`, etc.)
- Source maps enabled for debugging

### Utility Systems

- **Dice Rolling**: Comprehensive dice notation parser (`src/utils/dice.ts`) supporting standard RPG dice expressions with modal interface
- **Currency**: Utility functions for currency conversion between gold/silver/copper with automatic weight calculations
- **Validation**: Schema-based validation with TypeScript type guards and cascade validation for dependent fields
- **Cantrips & Spells**: Utility functions for spell management and class-specific availability
- **Sanitization**: HTML sanitization for user-generated content
- **Type Guards**: Runtime type checking utilities

## Working with Character Data

### Character Schema

The main `Character` interface includes:

- **Abilities**: 6 standard ability scores (STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON, CHA) with calculated modifiers
- **Race & Class**: Race selection and class array for multi-class support
- **Equipment**: Detailed equipment with properties (weapons, armor, cost, weight, damage, AC, etc.)
- **Currency**: Multi-currency system (platinum, gold, electrum, silver, copper) with automatic weight
- **Combat Stats**: Hit points, armor class, attack bonuses, saving throws
- **Magic**: Spell lists per class, cantrips, spell slots
- **Experience**: XP tracking and level progression
- **Personal**: Name, avatar, background details
- **Settings**: Feature flags, data version, supplemental content toggles

### Game Schema

The main `Game` interface includes:

- **Basic Info**: Game name, notes
- **Players**: Array linking user IDs to character IDs with resolved names/avatars
- **Combatants**: NPCs and monsters for encounters with AC and initiative tracking
- **Extensible**: Additional properties for future features

### Data Migration

When modifying character or game schemas:

**Character Schema Changes:**
1. Update the `Character` interface in `src/types/character.ts`
2. Add migration logic in `src/services/characterMigration.ts`
3. Increment version number in character settings

**Game Schema Changes:**
1. Update the `Game` interface in `src/types/game.ts`
2. Add migration logic for games if needed
3. Test with existing game data

### Firebase Environment Variables

- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`

### Code Review Prompt

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRIORITY: UI Component Usage** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Before conducting the standard code review, **FIRST** perform a thorough audit of UI component usage:

**üîç UI Component Duplication Assessment (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

1. **Scan for Custom UI Implementation:**
   - Search for inline styles, custom CSS classes, or hardcoded styling
   - Identify any custom button, input, card, modal, or layout implementations
   - Flag any component that recreates functionality available in `/src/components/ui/`

2. **Available UI Components Inventory:**
   - **Design System**: Card, Typography, Badge (from `/src/components/ui/design-system/`)
   - **Inputs**: Button, Select, TextInput, NumberInput, TextArea, Switch, OptionToggle, FileUpload, EditableValue, FloatingActionButton
   - **Feedback**: Modal, Notification, Tooltip, LoadingState, Callout, InfoTooltip, TooltipWrapper
   - **Display**: StatCard, ItemGrid, Stepper, BaseCard, DetailSection, Details, StatusIndicator, SectionHeader, Icon, HorizontalRule, Breadcrumb, SimpleRoller, SkillDescriptionItem, RequirementCard
   - **Layout**: Accordion, Tabs, PageWrapper, StepWrapper, SectionWrapper
   - **Dice**: RollableButton

3. **Code Duplication Red Flags:**
   - Multiple components implementing similar button styles ‚Üí Use `Button` component
   - Custom modal implementations ‚Üí Use `Modal` component
   - Hardcoded card layouts ‚Üí Use `Card` or `BaseCard` components
   - Custom input styling ‚Üí Use appropriate input components
   - Repeated stat display patterns ‚Üí Use `StatCard` or `StatGrid`
   - Custom loading spinners ‚Üí Use `LoadingState` component
   - Inline typography styles ‚Üí Use `Typography` component
   - Custom tooltip implementations ‚Üí Use `Tooltip` or `InfoTooltip`

4. **Mandatory Refactoring Requirements:**
   - **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Any custom UI implementation that duplicates existing UI components must be flagged for immediate refactoring
   - **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Provide specific examples showing how to replace custom implementations with existing UI components
   - **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Calculate the lines of code that could be eliminated by using UI components
   - **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Prioritize UI component adoption over all other code review feedback
