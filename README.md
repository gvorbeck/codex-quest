## Overview

Codex.Quest is a comprehensive web-based character creation and management system for Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game (BFRPG). Built with modern React architecture and a beautiful, accessible interface, it provides players and Game Masters with powerful tools to create, manage, and track characters throughout their adventures.

### Key Features

- Step-by-step character creation wizard with guided experience
- Complete BFRPG race and class support (Core + Supplemental + custom race and class creation)
- Persistent character storage with Firebase integration
- Character sheet display and live editing capabilities
- Comprehensive dice rolling system
- Game session creation and management
- Encounter management with initiative tracking
- Encount and Treasure generation tools
- Real-time data synchronization across devices

## Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **React 19** with functional components and hooks
- **TypeScript 5.9** for type-safe development
- **Vite 7.1** for fast development and optimized builds
- **TailwindCSS 4.1** with modern design tokens
- **Wouter 3.7** for lightweight client-side routing
- **TanStack Query 5.x** for server state management and caching
- **Zustand 5.x** for client-side state management with persistence

### Backend & Services

- **Firebase 12.2** for authentication and Firestore database
- **Real-time synchronization** for multiplayer features
- **Automated data migration** for schema evolution
- **Secure user authentication** with email/password and Google OAuth

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Quick Start (Mock Mode)

**Perfect for contributors and trying out the app:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gvorbeck/codex-quest.git
cd codex-quest

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (auto-detects mock mode)
npm run dev
```

ðŸŽ‰ **That's it!** The app automatically detects missing Firebase credentials and runs in mock mode with sample data.

### Production Installation

**For production deployment with Firebase:**

```bash
# Follow the steps above, then create .env with your Firebase config:
# VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
# VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
# VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
# VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
# VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
# VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
# VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Mock Mode for Contributors

Codex.Quest features an intelligent mock mode that **automatically activates** when Firebase credentials aren't available. This provides a **zero-setup experience** for contributors and demos.

### Development Utilities

When in mock mode, additional debugging tools are available:

#### UI Reset Button

- **Reset Sample Data** button appears in the header (orange button next to "Codex.Mock")
- Instantly resets all data back to original sample characters and games
- Reloads the page automatically to show fresh data

#### Console Commands

```javascript
// Available in browser console as window.devUtils
devUtils.resetAllData(); // Reset to sample data
devUtils.clearAllData(); // Clear all data
devUtils.signInAsUser(userData); // Test different users
devUtils.exportCharacterData(); // Export for debugging
devUtils.exportGameData(); // Export game data
```

### Manual Mock Mode

Force mock mode even with Firebase credentials:

```bash
VITE_MOCK_FIREBASE=true npm run dev
```

## Testing

We use a comprehensive two-layer testing approach for quality assurance:

**[Complete Testing Guide â†’ TEST_PLAN.md](./TEST_PLAN.md)**

### Testing Architecture

- **Unit Tests (Vitest)**: Fast feedback for individual functions and components
- **E2E Tests (Playwright)**: Complete user workflow validation across browsers
- **Visual Interfaces**: Beautiful web dashboards for both testing layers
- **Coverage Reports**: Track which code needs more testing\*\*

## Accessibility Features

- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** target
- **Screen reader support** with proper ARIA labels
- **Keyboard navigation** throughout the application
- **Skip links** and semantic HTML structure
- **High contrast support** and readable typography
- **Responsive design** for all device types
