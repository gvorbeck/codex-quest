## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Quick Start (Mock Mode)

**Perfect for contributors and trying out the app:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gvorbeck/codex-quest.git
cd codex-quest

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (auto-detects mock mode)
npm run dev
```

üéâ **That's it!** The app automatically detects missing Firebase credentials and runs in mock mode with sample data.

### Production Installation

**For production deployment with Firebase:**

```bash
# Follow the steps above, then create .env.local with your Firebase config:
# VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
# VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
# VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
# VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
# VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
# VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
# VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Available Scripts

| Command              | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`        | Start development server in **mock mode**      |
| `npm run dev:firebase` | Start development server with Firebase      |
| `npm run build`      | Build for production (TypeScript + Vite)      |
| `npm run preview`    | Preview production build locally              |
| `npm run lint`       | Run ESLint on TypeScript/React files          |

## üé≠ Mock Mode for Contributors

Codex.Quest features an intelligent mock mode that **automatically activates** when Firebase credentials aren't available. This provides a **zero-setup experience** for contributors and demos.

### üöÄ Auto-Detection Features

- **Instant Setup**: Works immediately without any configuration
- **Rich Sample Data**: 5 pre-built characters and 5 game sessions showcase all features
- **Full Functionality**: Character creation, editing, game management - everything works
- **Persistent Storage**: Data survives browser refresh using localStorage
- **Safe Environment**: Can't accidentally touch production data
- **Visual Indicators**: Header shows "Codex.Mock", orange favicon, reset button

### üéÆ Sample Data Included

**Characters:**
- **Thorin Ironforge** - Human Fighter (tank build)
- **Elara Moonwhisper** - Elf Magic-User (spellcaster)
- **Pip Lightfinger** - Halfling Thief (stealth specialist)
- **Brother Marcus** - Dwarf Cleric (support character)
- **Gareth the Versatile** - Multi-class Fighter/Thief

**Game Sessions:**
- **The Tavern Mystery** - Classic murder mystery investigation
- **Ruins of the Ancient Temple** - Dungeon crawl with undead
- **Journey to Dragonspear Castle** - Wilderness adventure
- **Conspiracy in Waterdeep** - Urban political intrigue
- **New Campaign** - Empty session ready for customization

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Utilities

When in mock mode, additional debugging tools are available:

#### UI Reset Button
- **Reset Sample Data** button appears in the header (orange button next to "Codex.Mock")
- Instantly resets all data back to original sample characters and games
- Reloads the page automatically to show fresh data

#### Console Commands
```javascript
// Available in browser console as window.devUtils
devUtils.resetAllData()          // Reset to sample data
devUtils.clearAllData()          // Clear all data
devUtils.signInAsUser(userData)  // Test different users
devUtils.exportCharacterData()   // Export for debugging
devUtils.exportGameData()        // Export game data
```

### ‚ö° Manual Mock Mode

Force mock mode even with Firebase credentials:

```bash
VITE_MOCK_FIREBASE=true npm run dev
```

### üß™ Testing Mock Mode

To test the mock mode implementation:

```bash
# Start in mock mode (auto-detects if no Firebase config)
npm run dev

# Or force mock mode explicitly
VITE_MOCK_FIREBASE=true npm run dev

# Then visit: http://localhost:5173 (or whatever port is shown)
```

The app will automatically populate with sample characters and games that you can interact with immediately.

## üß™ Testing

We use a comprehensive two-layer testing approach for quality assurance:

**For detailed explanations of each command and when to use them, see [TEST_PLAN.md](./TEST_PLAN.md)**

## üì± Accessibility Features

- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** target
- **Screen reader support** with proper ARIA labels
- **Keyboard navigation** throughout the application
- **Skip links** and semantic HTML structure

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch for your changes
3. Follow the existing code style and component patterns
4. Ensure all and linting is clean
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### Development Guidelines

üìö **[Read our comprehensive Style Guide](./src/components/STYLE_GUIDE.md)** for detailed development patterns, TypeScript best practices, performance optimization, and component architecture.

- Use existing UI components instead of creating custom implementations
- Follow the established component structure and naming conventions
- Write TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Include accessibility considerations in new components
- Test responsive behavior across device sizes

#### State Management Patterns

- **Server State**: Use TanStack Query hooks (`useCharacters`, `useCharacterSheet`, `useGame`)
- **Client State**: Use appropriate Zustand store (`characterStore`, `combatStore`, `uiStore`)
- **Query Keys**: Always use the centralized `queryKeys` factory for consistency
- **Mutations**: Implement optimistic updates with proper error rollback
- **Persistence**: Leverage Zustand persistence middleware for client preferences
