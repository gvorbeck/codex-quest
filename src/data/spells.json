Such undead monsters persist until slain, and obey the verbal commands of the caster. \n\nA single casting of this spell may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to twice the caster's level of ability, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of members of player character races, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. \n\nThe sort of monsters created depend on the condition of the remains. A reasonably intact corpse may only arise as a zombie, while similarly intact skeletal remains may only be animated as a skeleton. The caster chooses which remains are animated when casting the spell, in any case where there are more bodies than the caster can animate. \n\nNo character may normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times their level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast."

In general, animated objects attack using the same attack bonus as the caster. Small or lightweight objects do no more than 1d4 damage per hit, while larger and/or heavier objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the GM's discretion). As a special case, weapons which are animated do damage using the normal die roll for the type, but only up to a maximum 1d8. Animated objects have a movement rate of 10', and generally must move in contact with the ground (walking, hopping, slithering, or bouncing, however seems most appropriate to the GM)."

For example, if the shortest way requires the use of a key which the subject does not have, the spell will choose a different, probably longer way if possible. If this is not possible, the subject will be led to the locked door and will understand that they must find a way to pass through on their own. \n\nThe spell ends when the subject arrives at the destination or when the duration expires, whichever comes first. If the duration expires before arrival, the subject may still remember the approximate direction to the destination but will no longer know the way."

Metals with low melting points such as gold, silver, lead, copper, or bronze may be softened briefly and thus deformed, but the flames do not persist long enough to actually melt the metal items unless they are very small (such as a thin gold neck chain for example). \n\nWhile the fireball exerts little if any force or pressure when exploding, it may still destroy weak or flammable barriers; if such a thing happens (in the determination of the GM, of course), the fireball completes its expansion in the space beyond the destroyed barrier."

If the saving throw fails, the spirit of the target (now called the host) is trapped in the magic jar and the caster's spirit takes possession of the host's body. Possession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. \n\nIf the attempt to possess a victim fails, the caster's spirit remains in the magic jar, and that target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration of the spell. The caster may make an attempt to possess another target on the following round, if desired. \n\nIf on the other hand the possession attempt is successful, the caster may remain in control of the host's body for as long as desired. The caster's spirit may return to the magic jar at any time when it is within spell range, restoring the host's spirit to its own body. The caster may not return to the same host's body again for the remainder of the duration of this spell, but may attempt to possess it again on a subsequent casting. \n\nWhenever the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, it may choose to return to its own body if it is within spell range. If the body is not in range, the caster's spirit may become trapped if no vulnerable creatures are in range. \n\nWhenever the caster's spirit returns to their own body, the spell ends. There is a 50% chance that the magic jar will shatter when the spell ends (if the spell did not end because it was broken), becoming worthless and unusable. \n\nWhen the caster's spirit possesses a host, the caster has access to the physical abilities of the host's body, including Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, while still retaining their own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The caster has access only to their own knowledge, class and level, attack bonus, saving throws, spell casting ability, and any other purely mental capabilities. \n\nThe caster does not gain access to supernatural or otherwise extraordinary powers of the host, and may not be able to perform physical actions that the caster has never done before (such as flying, if a winged body has been possessed). The caster does have access to the host's sensory capabilities, such as Darkvision, the enhanced sense of smell of a dog, and so on. \n\nIf the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken (whether by dispel magic or physical damage), the caster's spirit will return to its own body if it is in spell range; if not, the caster's spirit departs (i.e. the caster dies). In either case, the spell ends. \n\nIf the caster's spirit is driven from the host body by dispel evil, and the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster's spirit returns to the jar and the host's spirit returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster's spirit departs, the host's spirit is freed from the jar and also departs, and the host's body dies. \n\nIf the host's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken while in spell range of the host body, the caster's spirit departs, the host's spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. If the jar is broken while out of range of the host's body, the host's spirit departs, the caster's spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. Dispel evil can still be \n\nused to drive the caster's spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell. A stranded caster may use another casting of this spell (with another magic jar, of course) to return to their own body, which of course kills the host's body."

Finally, the spell cannot detect a character's class, level, ability scores, or any other feature not obvious to a normal NPC. \n\nTriggers have an effective sensory range of 10 feet per caster level; sounds, sights, or actions outside that range will never trigger the spell."

The body forms over a period of 6 turns (i.e. an hour), first as a misty outline, then becoming more solid moment by moment until it takes its first breath and awakens. The new form is a young adult, unless the target was younger than that when they died, in which case the new body is the same age as the deceased body. \n\nThe target creature's new body has obviously suffered none of the harm that may have befallen the old one, and is completely healthy (at least, to start with). \n\nThe target remembers their previous life, and retains the same class (if possible for the new form) as well as its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character's ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.) The target loses one level (or hit die); this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. The target's hit points should be rerolled completely, as this is an entirely new body. If the target was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. \n\nCharacters turned into non-character humanoids (such as an elf who returns as a kobold) will require adjudication by the GM; if the restored target is a player character, the GM is counseled to give as much leeway to the player as possible with the character's new form. Conversely, non-character humanoids who return as characters will need all ability scores rolled; such characters will usually be fighters with a level equal to the target's previous hit dice minus 1, or as Normal Men if the target's previous hit dice were 1 or less. \n\nUndead creatures are not affected by this spell; such creatures can no longer be returned to life in any normal sense."

Any place where the caster lived for more than a month in the last ten years, or more than a year in their life, also qualifies. \n\nKnows Somewhat applies when the caster has spent substantial time in the destination area, but not enough to qualify for Knows Well. Alternately, the caster may have made an in-depth study of the area, looking at accurate drawings, maps, and floorplans or spending hours listening to descriptions from one or more people who Know Well the destination. \n\nSaw Once applies when the caster has visited a place for as much as a day, but no more, or when the caster has attempted the study required for the second definition of Knows Somewhat but has failed to acquire enough information (in the GM's opinion). \n\nIf the caster attempts to travel to a location that does not exist, or perhaps once existed but has been destroyed or otherwise changed so much that the caster would not recognize it, roll 2d20 instead d% for the result of the casting. In this case, if Success! is rolled the spell simply fails and no one is transported anywhere. \n\nSuccess! means exactly what it says. The caster, passengers, and cargo arrive safely exactly where the caster intended. \n\nFell Short indicates that the caster, passengers, and cargo arrive safely 1d8x10% of the way to the intended destination. Note that arriving \"safely\" does not mean that the destination is safe, but only the trip. \n\nWrong Place means that the caster, passengers, and cargo arrive at some place that resembles the intended destination. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range, as decided by the GM. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead. \n\nDisaster indicates that the caster, passengers, and cargo have encountered dimensional turbulence and have crashed, becoming separated (if passengers and/or cargo accompanied the caster) and being injured in the process. Each creature including the caster suffers 1d12 points of damage, and then rolls again on the same column using 2d20 instead of d%. If another Disaster is rolled for any creature, apply another 1d12 points of damage and roll once more. Cargo objects are not normally damaged but the result must be rolled for each such item to determine where it has appeared; in this case, if Disaster is rolled the cargo item disappears forever."

The caster may choose to make the wall smaller than the maximum size if desired. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick, and must always be created in contact with the ground or floor beneath it. It is always a flat plate with no bends, but the edges do not have to be straight; indeed, the caster can cause the wall edge to mold itself around any obstructing object very closely. The wall cannot otherwise be created such that it occupies the space of any object or creature. \n\nIf the caster wishes, the wall edges will bond to any inanimate materials they touch (stone walls, soil, furnishings, and so on). If this is not done, the wall may be unsupported (as determined by the GM based on the situation) and will thus likely fall. If left unattended, there is an equal chance it will fall in either direction in 1d6 rounds, but it can be pushed in a specific direction by any character having a minimum of Strength score of 13, or any monster with 4 or more hit dice. Several creatures can work together to do so if desired. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.) \n\nWhen the wall falls, any creatures it falls upon are likely to be injured or killed. If it is possible for a character or creature to escape the area (i.e. it has sufficient movement rate and is not otherwise prevented from doing so), it is allowed to roll a save vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). If this save is successful, the creature or character moves by the most direct route to the nearest safe space; if the save fails or it is for some reason impossible to flee, 10d6 points of damage are inflicted on that victim.

Each should roll a save vs. Death Ray, and any creatures who succeed at this save may move through the webbing but are reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again. \n\nThose who fail the save are fully entangled and trapped. They cannot move, cast spells, or perform normal attacks or any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed. \n\nAttacks against an entangled creature by one outside the webbing will not normally entrap the attacker, so long as they do not need to venture into the web to reach the entangled target. \n\nThe web can be ignited; any application of fire to the webbing will cause a 10 foot cube to burn away in one round, with all 10 foot cubes adjacent to the destroyed one burning in the next round, and so on. If any part of the web becomes unsupported it will collapse and disappear as noted above. \n\nCreatures trapped within the burning web suffer 2d4 points of damage when the cube they are trapped in burns, but they are thereafter completely free of the web."

The eye has Darkvision with a range of 30 feet, but otherwise sees exactly as the caster would. It can be created in any place the caster can see, up to a range of 240 feet away, and thereafter can move at a rate of 40 feet per round as directed by the caster. The eye will not move more than 240 feet away from the caster under any circumstances. The eye cannot pass through solid objects, but as it is exactly the size of a normal human's eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1 inch in diameter. The caster must concentrate to use the eye."

The caster of this spell can easily open the door or other portal without ending the spell, as can a Magic-User three or more levels higher than the caster."

If the caster or one of their passengers is holding an object that is also being held by an unwilling creature, the latter can retain possession of the object with a successful save vs. Spells."
