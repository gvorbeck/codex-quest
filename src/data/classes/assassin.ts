        "This is the Assassin's primary special ability. Any time an Assassin is behind an opponent in melee and it is reasonably likely the opponent doesn't know they are there, an attempt to assassinate may be made. The attack must be carried out with a one-handed piercing weapon, such as a dagger or sword. The attack is rolled at an attack bonus of +4, and if the attack hits, the victim must roll a saving throw vs. Death Ray or be instantly killed. If this saving throw is a success, the victim still suffers normal weapon damage.",

This is performed in much the same way as the Assassinate ability, but the Assassin must be using a weapon that does subduing damage normally (i.e. a club or cudgel). The attack is rolled at a +4 attack bonus; if the Assassin hits, the victim must make a saving throw vs. Death Ray or be knocked unconscious. Creatures knocked unconscious by a Waylay attack will remain that way for 2d8 turns if not awakened.",
