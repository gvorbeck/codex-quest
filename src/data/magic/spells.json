Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of members of player character races, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life.\n\nThe sort of monsters created depend on the condition of the remains. A reasonably intact corpse may only arise as a zombie, while similarly intact skeletal remains may only be animated as a skeleton. The caster chooses which remains are animated when casting the spell, in any case where there are more bodies than the caster can animate.\n\nNo character may normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times their level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast."

In general, animated objects attack using the same attack bonus as the caster. Small or lightweight objects do no more than 1d4 damage per hit, while larger and/or heavier objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the GM's discretion).

Obviously, verbal orders will only work if the target and caster share a spoken language, and the same limitation applies to written orders. Also note that the exact perception of the caster by the affected individual is not under the control of the caster; the GM should decide how the subject of this spell perceives its relationship to the caster.\n\nCommands that go against the target's basic nature or ask it to attack its own allies or friends grant it a fresh saving throw with a bonus of +5 on the roll. Even if the target fails this save it may still choose to do something else when commanded to perform an unwanted action. Of course, if the caster is attacked, the charmed creature will act to protect its \"friend\" (though that could mean attacking its own allies, which might cause the target to instead attempt to carry off the caster to a \"safe\" place).\n\nThe target receives a new saving throw each day if it has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, every week if its Intelligence is 9-12, or every month if its Intelligence is 8 or less; the GM must rule on the equivalent intelligence of humanoid monsters."

Even knowing the name of a location (if it has a name) is enough for this spell to function.\n\nThis spell works as well indoors or even underground as it does in the outdoors. However, find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. It can only lead someone to a destination that is on the same plane of existence as the caster when cast; this can be very limiting if the caster (and subject if any) is in a closed or pocket universe of some kind.\n\nThe subject can sense the approximate direction of the destination, but also knows the best path to get there, sensing each turning and knowing which paths or corridors to follow when choices appear (but not sooner, unfortunately). The spell even overcomes things such as secret doors, which the subject will sense and know how to open, and grants the knowledge of passwords or codes at the correct moments.\n\nNote that the spell will always choose the best path. For example, if the shortest way requires the use of a key which the subject does not have, the spell will choose a different, probably longer way if possible. If this is not possible, the subject will be led to the locked door and will understand that they must find a way to pass through on their own.\n\nThe spell ends when the subject arrives at the destination or when the duration expires, whichever comes first.

Those within the area of the flames suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level, with a saving throw vs. Spells allowed for half damage.\n\nNo roll is normally required when casting this spell, but if the caster wishes to project the ember through a slit or other small opening they must roll a missile attack (without range adjustments) to hit it; failure indicates the fireball hits an adjacent surface and detonates there.\n\nCombustible objects or substances within the area of effect will generally catch fire and possibly be destroyed (as determined by the GM). Metals with low melting points such as gold, silver, lead, copper, or bronze may be softened briefly and thus deformed, but the flames do not persist long enough to actually melt the metal items unless they are very small (such as a thin gold neck chain for example).\n\nWhile the fireball exerts little if any force or pressure when exploding, it may still destroy weak or flammable barriers; if such a thing happens (in the determination of the GM, of course), the fireball completes its expansion in the space beyond the destroyed barrier."

It ends instantly if the target attacks an opponent or casts any spell. Other actions do not normally end the spell. The target may end the spell at will.\n\nObjects that shed light may be made invisible but the light itself will remain visible, and the source of that light (and the character carrying it) can thus be discovered. Rain, dust, paint, and any other visible substance thrown or applied to an invisible creature will also render it detectable."

Levitation allows the caster to cause the subject to rise or fall at a rate of as much as 20 feet per round.\n\nIf a target creature is unwilling, the caster must roll a successful attack roll in order to touch the target, and even if this roll succeeds the target is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist the magic. Likewise, if the target is an object being held by an unwilling creature, a similar attack roll and saving throw will be required. Unattended objects are automatically affected when touched.\n\nThe caster controls the levitating subject mentally. If the caster ceases to control the subject, it remains at its current altitude until the spell ends, at which point it falls.\n\nLevitation does not provide any means of horizontal movement, but neither is the levitated subject fixed in place. It can be moved by pushing or by towing with a rope, for example. A creature being levitated can pull itself along a cliff face or across a ceiling, or pull itself with a rope fixed to a solid object. Movement of this sort is usually at half normal walking speed. The subject cannot, however, change its own altitude.\n\nIf a levitating creature attempts to attack with most weapons it will find that it is unstable. The first such attack is made at a penalty of -1 on the attack roll, and this penalty worsens by an additional -1 each round to a maximum penalty of -5. Should the creature refrain from making an attack for a full round, it is reduced to the -1 penalty level on the next round. This does not usually affect spellcasting while levitated, however."

If a lightning bolt is cast underwater it explodes in the same way, but at the tip of the caster's outstretched finger.\n\nThe lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can damage metals with a low melting point; metals such as gold, silver, lead, copper, or bronze may be softened briefly and thus deformed, but the lightning does not persist long enough to actually melt the metal items unless they are very small (such as a thin gold neck chain for example).\n\nIf the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back toward the caster, or in a random direction at the GM's option.

The caster begins by placing their spirit into a gem, jewel, or large crystal of some sort within the spell range, called the magic jar. The caster needs to know where the magic jar is located, but does not have to be able to see it. While the caster's spirit is outside their body, that body appears to all intents and purposes to be dead, but does not undergo decay as a normal dead body would.\n\nEach round after entering the magic jar the caster's spirit can attempt to take control of the body of a living creature within the spell range; the target is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. If the saving throw fails, the spirit of the target (now called the host) is trapped in the magic jar and the caster's spirit takes possession of the host's body. Possession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward.\n\nIf the attempt to possess a victim fails, the caster's spirit remains in the magic jar, and that target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration of the spell. The caster may make an attempt to possess another target on the following round, if desired.\n\nIf on the other hand the possession attempt is successful, the caster may remain in control of the host's body for as long as desired. The caster's spirit may return to the magic jar at any time when it is within spell range, restoring the host's spirit to its own body. The caster may not return to the same host's body again for the remainder of the duration of this spell, but may attempt to possess it again on a subsequent casting.\n\nWhenever the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, it may choose to return to its own body if it is within spell range. If the body is not in range, the caster's spirit may become trapped if no vulnerable creatures are in range.\n\nWhenever the caster's spirit returns to their own body, the spell ends. There is a 50% chance that the magic jar will shatter when the spell ends (if the spell did not end because it was broken), becoming worthless and unusable.\n\nWhen the caster's spirit possesses a host, the caster has access to the physical abilities of the host's body, including Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, while still retaining their own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The caster has access only to their own knowledge, class and level, attack bonus, saving throws, spell casting ability, and any other purely mental capabilities.\n\nThe caster does not gain access to supernatural or otherwise extraordinary powers of the host, and may not be able to perform physical actions that the caster has never done before (such as flying, if a winged body has been possessed). The caster does have access to the host's sensory capabilities, such as Darkvision, the enhanced sense of smell of a dog, and so on.\n\nIf the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken (whether by dispel magic or physical damage), the caster's spirit will return to its own body if it is in spell range; if not, the caster's spirit departs (i.e. the caster dies). In either case, the spell ends.\n\nIf the caster's spirit is driven from the host body by dispel evil, and the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster's spirit returns to the jar and the host's spirit returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster's spirit departs, the host's spirit is freed from the jar and also departs, and the host's body dies.\n\nIf the host's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken while in spell range of the host body, the caster's spirit departs, the host's spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. If the jar is broken while out of range of the host's body, the host's spirit departs, the caster's spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. Dispel evil can still be\n\nused to drive the caster's spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell. A stranded caster may use another casting of this spell (with another magic jar, of course) to return to their own body, which of course kills the host's body."

Likewise, stealth or magical silence are effective in preventing audible triggers. Finally, the spell cannot detect a character's class, level, ability scores, or any other feature not obvious to a normal NPC.\n\nTriggers have an effective sensory range of 10 feet per caster level; sounds, sights, or actions outside that range will never trigger the spell."

The barrier moves with the subject, and provides three specific forms of magical protection against attacks or other effects attempted by the affected creatures against the subject.\n\nFirst, the subject receives a bonus of +2 to their Armor Class, and a similar bonus of +2 on all saving throws.\n\nSecond, the barrier blocks all attempts to charm or otherwise control the subject, or to possess the subject (such as with magic jar). Such attempts simply fail during the duration of this spell.

Once subjected to this spell, the subject must obey the instructions given by the caster indefinitely, though if the quest is to perform some action the spell effectively ends when that action has been completed.\n\nFor every 24 hours that an affected creature chooses not to obey the quest (or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers 3d6 points of damage. This damage is limited, in that it will not kill the target; if the damage is enough to do so, roll 1d4 for the number of hit points the affected creature retains (similar to the spell harm, the reverse of heal).\n\nIf the task assigned to the subject of this spell is open ended or otherwise unable to be completed, the subject is still compelled to try to perform the task, but the spell will end in no more than one day per caster level.\n\nVery clever creatures may be able to subvert the instructions given; the GM must decide on the results of any such attempts.\n\nA quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster of the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell.

It will also fail if the target died of old age, as the body simply has no life left in it. Similarly, undead creatures are not affected by this spell as they can no longer be returned to life in any normal sense.\n\nThe body of the target must be adequately intact to support life, but all wounds no matter how major are healed. Body parts missing when the target is raised are still missing afterward. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone.\n\nCreatures brought back from the dead always suffer some loss or penalty from the ordeal. Characters lose one level of ability permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). First level characters are reduced to Normal Man status; if the character was already a Normal Man they lose a point of Constitution. These losses are permanent, though of course the character may gain levels in the normal fashion. (Characters reduced to Normal Man status must gain 1,000 XP to return to 1st level).\n\nMonstrous humanoids (orcs, goblins, and the like) lose one hit die, or are reduced to ½ hit dice if the monster has just one to start with. Such humanoids who already have ½ hit dice are reduced to a single hit point. These losses are generally permanent, though the GM may allow such creatures in service to a player character to recover by gaining 1,000 XP per hit die the creature would be returning to (so a lizard man who has been reduced to 1 hit die must earn 2,000 XP to return to its original 2 hit dice); treat such a creature as being a retainer for this purpose.\n\nUpon being raised, the target has 1 hit point per level or hit die (using its current reduced figure, of course), with a minimum of 1 hit point. A character who died with spells prepared has none prepared upon being raised.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, slay living, will kill instantly the creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a humanoid) unless a save vs. Spells is made. If the saving throw is successful, 2d6 points of damage is dealt to the victim instead. An attack roll is required to apply this spell in combat."

If an NPC is being reincarnated, the GM may choose or roll again.\n\nWhen the spell is cast, a new body forms in a nearby location selected by the caster. The body forms over a period of 6 turns (i.e. an hour), first as a misty outline, then becoming more solid moment by moment until it takes its first breath and awakens. The new form is a young adult, unless the target was younger than that when they died, in which case the new body is the same age as the deceased body.\n\nThe target creature's new body has obviously suffered none of the harm that may have befallen the old one, and is completely healthy (at least, to start with).\n\nThe target remembers their previous life, and retains the same class (if possible for the new form) as well as its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character's ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.) The target loses one level (or hit die); this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. The target's hit points should be rerolled completely, as this is an entirely new body. If the target was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction its new Constitution score is reduced by 2.\n\nCharacters turned into non-character humanoids (such as an elf who returns as a kobold) will require adjudication by the GM; if the restored target is a player character, the GM is counseled to give as much leeway to the player as possible with the character's new form. Conversely, non-character humanoids who return as characters will need all ability scores rolled; such characters will usually be fighters with a level equal to the target's previous hit dice minus 1, or as Normal Men if the target's previous hit dice were 1 or less.\n\nUndead creatures are not affected by this spell; such creatures can no longer be returned to life in any normal sense."

It does not matter how long the corpse has been dead, but it must be essentially intact with at least a complete mouth in order to answer questions.\n\nThe corpse will answer at most one question per two caster levels, but if the duration expires any remaining questions are lost. The corpse only knows what it knew when it was alive; this includes the languages it knew in life. Thus, the caster must share a language with the deceased in order to get any questions answered at all.\n\nThe answers given are drawn from knowledge \"imprinted\" on the corpse during life; the caster does not in any case actually communicate with the spirit of the deceased creature. The corpse cannot retain any information given to it, and does not even remember any previous instances of communication via this spell.\n\nThe answers given may not be useful for various reasons. If the corpse knew the caster when it was alive, or if the caster is a member of a group the deceased disliked, it may choose to lie or mislead the caster. If the caster asks the corpse questions of a personal nature, or questions that indicate the caster may be working against whatever interests the corpse had in life, it will almost certainly seek to mislead the caster.\n\nIf the corpse has been roused by this spell within the last seven days, the spell will fail. Undead creatures (including the remains of defeated undead creatures) cannot be affected by this spell."

The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a successful save vs. Spells will prevent items in a creature's possession from being teleported.\n\nThe spell is directed by the mind of the caster, who must visualize the destination area; failure to visualize it properly can cause the spell to fail in a variety of ways, and destinations heavily saturated with magical energy (as defined by the Game Master) will cause the spell to fail automatically.\n\nTo determine the results of this spell, choose the appropriate column on the table below, then roll d%.\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Knows Well</th><th>Knows Somewhat</th><th>Saw Once</th><th>Spell Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>01</th><th>01-02</th><th>01-03</th><th>Disaster</th></tr><tr><th>02</th><th>03-07</th><th>04-13</th><th>Wrong Place</th></tr><tr><th>03</th><th>08-13</th><th>14-25</th><th>Fell Short</th></tr><tr><th>04-00</th><th>12-00</th><th>26-00</th><th>Success!</th></tr></tbody></table>\n\nKnows Well applies when the caster has visited the destination frequently and/or spent a substantial amount of time there; generally, the caster should have spent at least 7 days (not necessarily in a row) at the destination within the last year to qualify for this category. Any place where the caster lived for more than a month in the last ten years, or more than a year in their life, also qualifies.\n\nKnows Somewhat applies when the caster has spent substantial time in the destination area, but not enough to qualify for Knows Well. Alternately, the caster may have made an in-depth study of the area, looking at accurate drawings, maps, and floorplans or spending hours listening to descriptions from one or more people who Know Well the destination.\n\nSaw Once applies when the caster has visited a place for as much as a day, but no more, or when the caster has attempted the study required for the second definition of Knows Somewhat but has failed to acquire enough information (in the GM's opinion).\n\nIf the caster attempts to travel to a location that does not exist, or perhaps once existed but has been destroyed or otherwise changed so much that the caster would not recognize it, roll 2d20 instead d% for the result of the casting. In this case, if Success! is rolled the spell simply fails and no one is transported anywhere.\n\nSuccess! means exactly what it says. The caster, passengers, and cargo arrive safely exactly where the caster intended.\n\nFell Short indicates that the caster, passengers, and cargo arrive safely 1d8x10% of the way to the intended destination. Note that arriving \"safely\" does not mean that the destination is safe, but only the trip.\n\nWrong Place means that the caster, passengers, and cargo arrive at some place that resembles the intended destination. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range, as decided by the GM. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.\n\nDisaster indicates that the caster, passengers, and cargo have encountered dimensional turbulence and have crashed, becoming separated (if passengers and/or cargo accompanied the caster) and being injured in the process. Each creature including the caster suffers 1d12 points of damage, and then rolls again on the same column using 2d20 instead of d%. If another Disaster is rolled for any creature, apply another 1d12 points of damage and roll once more. Cargo objects are not normally damaged but the result must be rolled for each such item to determine where it has appeared; in this case, if Disaster is rolled the cargo item disappears forever."

The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller than the maximum size if desired. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick, and must always be created in contact with the ground or floor beneath it. It is always a flat plate with no bends, but the edges do not have to be straight; indeed, the caster can cause the wall edge to mold itself around any obstructing object very closely. The wall cannot otherwise be created such that it occupies the space of any object or creature.\n\nIf the caster wishes, the wall edges will bond to any inanimate materials they touch (stone walls, soil, furnishings, and so on). If this is not done, the wall may be unsupported (as determined by the GM based on the situation) and will thus likely fall. If left unattended, there is an equal chance it will fall in either direction in 1d6 rounds, but it can be pushed in a specific direction by any character having a minimum of Strength score of 13, or any monster with 4 or more hit dice. Several creatures can work together to do so if desired. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.)\n\nWhen the wall falls, any creatures it falls upon are likely to be injured or killed. If it is possible for a character or creature to escape the area (i.e. it has sufficient movement rate and is not otherwise prevented from doing so), it is allowed to roll a save vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). If this save is successful, the creature or character moves by the most direct route to the nearest safe space; if the save fails or it is for some reason impossible to flee, 10d6 points of damage are inflicted on that victim. Creatures larger than ogre-sized are immune to being crushed and will simply be knocked down if the save fails.\n\nThe wall is permanent, as indicated, but being made of iron is susceptible to rust and corrosion."

The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The wall cannot be created such that it occupies the space of any object or creature. It must be adequately supported by existing stone, which it will bond with automatically, but need not be supported over its entire area.

No complex structural elements may be created by this spell.\n\nThough made by magic, the wall is made of stone and can be broken or damaged just as if it were ordinary stone.\n\nThe wall can be formed into a container to trap creatures, and if this is attempted the targets of the spell are allowed to save vs. Death Ray to avoid being trapped.

The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed a save vs. Death Ray.\n\nCastles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since rock to mud cannot affect worked stone and doesn’t reach deep enough to undermine such a buildings’ foundation.

Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.\n\nWhen using the reverse, mud to rock, the spell converts the same volume of mud into relatively soft stone (such as limestone or sandstone) permanently.

Some materials may prevent passage such as lead, gold, or other materials with special properties (as determined by the GM). While able to move through materials and effectively weightless, the ectoplasmic being does not gain any other special movement modes like flying or levitation; walking upon materials such as water is possible though.\n\nThe character in an ectoplasmic state may not make physical attacks but may cast spells that do not require physical contact. While the spell is active, the individual may choose to revert back and forth between corporeal and incorporeal forms on their turn, remaining in the chosen state until their next turn. The spell cannot be cast upon on an unwilling individual and fails completely if attempted. Likewise, unintelligent or animal intelligence creatures do not possess understanding of changing their physical state, so the spell is wasted on them."

Another benefit of this spell is that each turn the Necromancer rests inside the grave counts as a full hour of sleep, so the Necromancer may meditate to memorize spells while within the magical sanctuary. Also, if the grave site is on unhallowed ground or an area otherwise associated with hauntings and the like, then the Necromancer heals 1d4 HP per turn spent inside the grave.\n\nWhile inside the grave, the Necromancer does lose any sense of taste, smell, or touch, and may not speak or otherwise cast spells while inside the grave's protection. If the grave itself is unearthed or broken into in some way, then the Necromancer takes 2d10 points of damage and is cast out into the nearest available space.

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects:\n\nFirst, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and on saves. Both of these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by undead creatures or beings that the GM decides have a strong connection with death or undead.\n\nSecond, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a **magic jar** attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including **charm** spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the **protection from undead** spell. If the **protection from undead** effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.\n\nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are undead or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.\n\nReversed, this spell becomes quite potent as **protection from living**. It functions in all ways as described above, save that “living” creatures are kept away, rather than dead or “undead” creatures. Necromancers often use both versions of the spell to protect themselves from threats by both the living population as well as powerful undead that may try to command the Necromancer such as ghosts or vampires."

Once the spell is cast, the trigger methods cannot be changed.\n\nTriggering methods can be further modified by qualifiers, type of creature, race of creature, number of creatures, skip some number of triggers (so it is the third creature to touch it, not the first or second), or any other qualifier that is based on observable actions or details.\n\nThe symbol may also be assigned a password that will temporarily disable the symbol when the password is said as a creature enters the range of the symbol. Each time the range is entered, the password must be said again or the symbol will go off. This is set at the time of casting and cannot be changed."

    "description": "As a vile necromantic alternative to the reincarnation spell, this spell can be used to bring back individuals to the world of the living. Upon casting this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or creature) in an undead state, whether as some sort of reanimated body or as spiritual or ghost-like form. Wicked, cruel, murderous, or so-called evil beings will often want to continue their predations in undeath, but for most beings the subject's soul is not willing to return in such a state. Most normal individuals roll a saving throw vs. Spells to avoid coming back (rolled as if they were still alive and well), and if successful the spell fails completely as the soul cannot be compelled to return.\n\nRoll on the following table to determine what sort of undead creature the character becomes. Entries marked with (FG) indicate creatures from the **Basic Fantasy Field Guide**.\n\n| d% | Undead Form |\n|---|---|\n| 01-25 | Ghoul |\n| 26–40 | Ghast (FG) |\n| 41-50 | Mummy |\n| 51-55 | Spectre |\n| 56-60 | Vampire |\n| 61-75 | Wight |\n| 81-90 | Wraith |\n| 85-90 | Ghost |\n| 91-00 | Other (GM's choice) |\n\nSince the dead character is returning in a state of undeath, all physical ills and afflictions are generally irrelevant. The condition of the remains is not really a factor so long as the body is largely intact. The magic of the spell repairs or otherwise accommodates any changes necessary to conform to the new undead state, the process taking one hour to complete. When the spell is finished, the new undead being becomes aware and active. The caster has absolutely no special control over the newly-'risen' being. Of course, subsequent spells may be cast, having completely normal effects upon the new undead.\n\nThe newly-undead character recalls the majority of its former life and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (but see below). The physical abilities of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution should be re-rolled or determined by the parameters of the new form. The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. The subject of this spell takes on all the abilities, hindrances, and disadvantages of the new undead state, having either the undead creature's normal hit dice or will have hit points according to the character's reduced level, whichever is higher. In either case, the character's class abilities are available to the newly-risen form excepting any obviously contradicting situations. For instance, Climbing is probably of little importance to a ghost-like form.\n\nThe spell can thus create generally-superior undead beings who often go on to lead others of their kind. The undead creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but also must confront any special tendencies of the new state. For instance, a newly-risen ghoul hungers voraciously for fetid flesh, and a new vampire thirsts for blood. The compulsions of the undead is very strong, and the behaviors will soon overcome any previous relationships with living beings, although it may experience remorse over killing its former friends. For undead such as ghouls, ghasts, wights, and similar beings, the urges to kill and feed are so strong that they can become effectively mindless (-6 to Intelligence and Wisdom scores) until the urges are temporarily satisfied. Vampires have a bit more conscious control over their hunger and do not have this penalty. For other types of undead not listed here, the GM may assign relevant behaviors that must be followed.\n\nConstructs, elementals, and similar creatures cannot become undead. The creature must have originally been a living corporeal being with some semblance of intelligence. The GM has the final say whether this spell affects any specific being. Likewise the GM decides any special situations or special manifestations that may occur from the use of this spell. Generally, any character who becomes an undead immediately becomes an NPC under the control of the GM unless he or she has made special accommodations to allow for undead player characters.\n\n_**Note**: this spell is intended only for Necromancers, as the other spell-casting classes have access to similar types of spells (**reincarnation** and **raise dead**)._"

The wall is composed of up to one 10- x 10-foot square section, 1 foot thick, per caster level. Unlike the similar spell, wall of stone, the caster may not double the wall's area by halving its thickness, as the structure is already very porous and would lose its structural integrity, but of course the wall can be made thicker. For instance, a 10th-level caster could conjure a section to fill in a 10-foot cube (10 feet x 10 feet x 1 foot, 10 sections thick). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall does not require concentration to maintain, but falls to pieces at the end of the spell duration.\n\nThe spell also differs from the wall of stone spell in that the semi-animated wall attacks those within close proximity to its structure (10 feet) for 2d4 points of piercing and slashing damage from the bones. The structure is not completely solid, so high-strength individuals may attempt to break through with a Strength check, but they take an additional 2d6+1/level points of damage while making the attempt for each 1 foot of thickness that they attempt to move through. A separate Strength check is necessary for each 1 foot of thickness of the wall section in order to break through. The bone wall does not attack the caster or any undead creatures. The wall of bones may be fashioned into simple structures such as ramps or bridges to span a rift, but these uses reduce the size by half so that supporting arches or buttresses can be included."

The freed familiar loses all benefits gained from this spell and becomes a normal animal. The master is affected as if their familiar has died.
