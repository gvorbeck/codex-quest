    description:
      "Dwarves are a short, stocky race; both male and female Dwarves stand around four feet tall and typically weigh around 120 pounds. Their long hair and thick beards are dark brown, gray or black. They take great pride in their beards, sometimes braiding or forking them. They have a fair to ruddy complexion. Dwarves have stout frames and a strong, muscular build. They are rugged and resilient, with the capacity to endure great hardships. Dwarves are typically practical, stubborn and courageous. They can also be introspective, suspicious and possessive. They have a lifespan of three to four centuries.\n\n**Restrictions**: Dwarves may become Clerics, Fighters, or Thieves. They are required to have a minimum Constitution of 9. Due to their generally dour dispositions, they may not have a Charisma higher than 17. They may not employ Large weapons more than four feet in length (specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and longbows).\n\n**Special Abilities**: All Dwarves have Darkvision (see page 43) with a 60' range, and are able to detect slanting passages, stonework traps, shifting walls and new construction on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6; a search must be performed before this roll may be made.\n\n**Saving Throws**: Dwarves save at +4 vs. Death Ray or Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and at +3 vs. Dragon Breath.",
