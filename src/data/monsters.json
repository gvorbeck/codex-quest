    "description": "Giant ants are fantastically enlarged versions of the more common variety of ants. Normal workers are 5 to 6 feet long; queens are larger, growing up to 9 feet in length. Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical difference between them. Though relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death. They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair. \n\nGiant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets. \n\nLarge and huge ants are similar to giant ants in all ways except for size; large ants are 1 to 2 feet long, while huge ants are 3 to 4 feet in length. Though smaller, their colonies have more members, and so their lair treasures are of similar size to those found in the lairs of giant ants."

They are pack hunters by nature, but when encountered singly or in small groups pose shyly when their numbers are overwhelming. Use the higher morale figure when a barkling group outnumbers their enemies by 3 combatants to 1 or more.\n\nBarklings can deliver a nasty bite but prefer to fight with weapons, favoring small weapons made for their stature and relative lack of strength; all such weapons do 1d4 points of damage on a hit.\n\nBarklings see well in the dark, having Darkvision with a range of 30 feet, but their sense of smell is where they excel; a barkling can track almost any living or corporeal undead creature by scent, even if it has been as much as a day since it passed.\n\nIn combat barklings usually wear chainmail armor which they craft themselves (as shown in the Armor Class given above).\n\nOne out of every ten barklings will be a warrior with 1 hit die (25 XP). In barkling encampments, one out of every twenty will be a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In villages of 50 or more there will be a barkling lord of 3 hit dice (145 XP) who has +1 bonus to damage. Barklings gain a +1 bonus to their morale as long as they are led by any of their leaders.\n\nIn addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a wizard being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a chieftain is present). A wizard is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior barkling statistically, but has Magic-User abilities at level 1d4+1. For XP purposes, treat the wizard barkling as if it has a number of hit dice equal to its magic-user level -1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.\n\nBarklings are sometimes confused with kobolds, for whom they have a particular hatred; calling a barkling a kobold or suggesting that the two species are related is considered a terrible insult."

    "description": "A basilisk is a giant six-legged lizard-like monster that petrifies living creatures with its gaze. A basilisk has dark brown, green, or black skin on its back and a pale yellow or white belly. Adults reach a body length of 5 to 7 feet with a tail of roughly equal length, and a weight of 250 to 400 pounds. There is no particular difference in size between males and females.\n\nAny living creature meeting the gaze of a basilisk must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone instantly. In general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror it may see its reflection.\n\nThe greater basilisk appears identical to the common variety, save that it is larger, having a body length of about 8 feet with a 7 to 9 foot long tail and weighing between 400 and 750 pounds. The skin of the greater basilisk is toxic to the touch, such that any living creature bitten by one or who touches one with bare skin must save vs. Poison or die. This effect persists even after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20 hours; the only way to tell if the effect has subsided is to touch the corpse, an obviously bad idea."

When one knows of the attacker's presence, it is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray, and on a successful roll teleports 1d6 x 10 feet in a random direction (but never into solid matter, nor into any dangerous area the creature knows about). \n\nThese creatures are pack hunters, using their teleportation to confuse their prey until they are able to surround it. In this way, some members of the pack will be able to attack from behind, a trick they are so good at that they receive the same benefits as a thief: +4 to hit and double damage if the hit is successful.\n\nBlink dogs are large canines, typically light brown in color with short bristly hair; some varieties are striped or spotted. They communicate using a language of barks, growls, and yips which is somewhat limited but can convey useful tactical information. They are shy, generally avoiding a fight if possible, but they hate deceivers and will generally attack them on sight."

Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal conditions.

    "description": "Cattle are large mammals with cloven hooves and horned heads. Cattle are raised mostly for their meat (beef), leather, and milk. Cattle eat grass and are fairly gentle unless spooked, in which case they will stampede (run in a group). Anyone caught in the path of the stampede will suffer at least one trampling attack, as determined by the GM. Male cattle are called bulls, females are cows, and young are calves (calf is singular). If attacked, cattle will charge, generally using their horns to attack. Bulls are larger (+1 hit die), less easily frightened (use the second listed morale figure), and are quite aggressive in defense of the herd. A bull will likely attack if he sees quick movements from creatures he might be able to reach with a charge. Meanwhile, if unable to flee cows will usually assume a roughly circular formation with their heads outward, while calves will be kept in the center, though if the opponents are small enough they may instead charge en masse, trampling all creatures in their path.\n\nA typical small farm with cattle will have a bull, 5d4 cows, and 2d10 calves (but not more than the number of cows).\n\nAurochs are wild cattle; they are shaggy and rough-looking. Bison are the largest species of wild bovines. All types of bovines tend to behave in the same general way, as described above.\n\nAn ox is typically a castrated bull used as a draft animal; females may be used, rarely, but males are preferred due to their greater size and strength. Oxen are usually paired as a team to pull a fully-loaded wagon (or the equivalent of 3,000 lb). Oxen require less food and water, being able to eat rough grasses better than draft horses, which makes them valuable to merchants with large caravans going over semi-arid prairie."

The GM should roll a wandering monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.\n\nAny giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent) will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit. This does not interrupt the monster's shrieking.\n\nA giant cave locust can leap up to 60' horizontally, or up to 30' up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from the impact.\n\nFinally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its digestive juices) up to 10' away. Each giant cave locust can perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell."

    "description": "Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish \"true\" dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven\"age categories,\" ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons. \n\nIf one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of \n\n12 in combat since they are protecting their young. In combat dragons use a powerful bite, slashing claws, a long, whiplike tail, and most famously some form of breath weapon. Tactically, dragons prefer to fight whileflying, making passes over ground-based enemies to strike or breathe on them. Smarter and older dragons will look for the toughest or most dangerous foe to strike down first, particularly preferring to eliminate magic-users as early in a fight as possible. \n\nEach dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail in the same round. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them. \n\nThe breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it. \n\nThere are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a \"normal\" shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon can produce all three shapes. \n\nThe shapes are: \n\n**Cone Shaped**: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age). \n\n**Line Shaped**: The breath weapon is 5' wide (regardless of the given width figure) and extends the given length in a straight line. \n\n**Cloud Shaped**: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, any length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high. \n\nAll dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of \"talking;\" this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or some other humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for \"talking\" is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak. \n\nSome dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately. \n\nAll dragons crave wealth, hoarding as many coins, gems, items of jewelry, and best of all magic items in their lair as possible. The greater a dragon's hoard, the less it will seek to leave its lair, though of course it must hunt for food from time to time. Dragons rarely trust any other creature to defend their hoard, though some will entice aggressive but unintelligent creatures to live nearby in the hopes that they will kill and eat any thieves who might come nosing around. \n\nUnlike other monsters, multiple dragons encountered in a lair together do not share treasure; generate a full treasure for each dragon individually. Treasure for dragons is special, as noted on the table on page 163. The odds of monetary treasure increase with the monster's age category, while the chances of gems, jewelry, and magic items are based upon its hit dice. \n\nYoung dragons typically have brightly colored, glossy skin; as a dragon ages, both the color and the sheen slowly become dull. \n\n**Experience Points (XP)** given for dragons on the following pages are for non-spell-casting dragons of age category 4. The GM must calculate the XP award for any specific dragon as given on page 49, adding a special ability bonus (i.e. a \"star\") if the dragon casts spells."

One will wait in this fashion until victims come within 100 feet, then spring out and attack (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).\n\nA desert dragon will usually choose to lair in an underground cavern, or perhaps in a ruined castle or desert outpost. They are evil monsters, though not so fierce as mountain dragons. They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a desert dragon will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with that person as a cat plays with a mouse.\n\nDesert dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only half damage from magical lightning.\n\n| Age Cat. | Hit Dice | Attack Bonus | Breath Weapon | L | W | Talk % | Spells by Level |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 6 | +7 | Lightning (Line) | 80' | - | 0% | - - - - - - |\n| 2 | 7 | +8 | Lightning (Line) | 90' | - | 15% | 1 - - - - - |\n| 3 | 8 | +9 | Lightning (Line) | 100' | - | 20% | 2 1 - - - - |\n| 4      | 9    | +9      | Lightning (Line) | 110'  | -   | 40%      | 3 2 - - - -   |\n| 5      | 10    | +10     | Lightning (Line) | 120'  | 55'  | 50%      | 4 2 1 - - -   |\n| 6      | 11    | +10     | Lightning (Line) | 110'  | 60'  | 60%      | 4 2 1 - - -   |\n| 7      | 12    | +11     | Lightning (Line) | 120'  | 60'  | 70%      | 4 3 2 1 - -   |"

Once per day a dryad can cast a charm similar to the spell charm person, and one may choose to use this ability to compel an interesting human or elf to remain with her as a companion for a period of up to a year. The companion can be taken into and brought out of the dryad's tree so long as the charm is still in effect."

    "description": "Eagles are large birds with wingspans 6½ to 7½ feet in width. They stand about 2½ to 3 feet tall and weigh about 13 lbs. These birds have heavy talons and large beaks with a sharp hooked end. Eagles are known to carry prey up to 15 lbs. An eagle will also kill and start to eat animals that are 5 times the eagle's size, up to 80 lbs. Fish-eating eagles are usually the largest varieties, while other types hunt small animals such as rodents or snakes. Coloring is dependent on the species of eagle, and should be chosen by the GM; various brown, gray, black, or white markings are most common, though solid darker colors are sometimes seen. The beaks may range from bright yellowish orange to black. Eagles will dive at a prey and attack with both sets of talons, then attack with the beak."

They are intelligent creatures, and many speak Common or another language common in their home territory.\n\nIndividual giant eagles are rarely encountered alone, as they prefer to live in loose communities. However, when they hunt they do so in a solitary fashion, with each eagle choosing a single creature as prey. As they can communicate with each other, it is extremely rare for two of them to make the mistake of attacking the same prey; in fact, it is not uncommon for one to attack alone to scatter a group of prey so they can each more easily choose a victim.\n\nGiant eagles mate for life. If a nest with eggs or hatchlings is threatened, both parents will fight without checking morale, and other giant eagles in their community may come to their defense but will still seek to scatter any opponents so as to attack them one on one."

They are large beings, 11 to 12 feet in height and weighing around 2,000 pounds, though their weight is generally immaterial due to their ability to fly by magical means.\n\nNote that the 12 morale reflects an efreeti's absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use the \"9\" figure to determine whether an outmatched efreeti decides to leave a combat.\n\nEfreet have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): become **invisible**, with unlimited uses per day; assume **gaseous form**, as the potion, up to one hour per day; **create illusions**, as the spell **phantasmal force** but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day; **create flame**, with unlimited uses; and create a **wall of fire** (as the spell), once per day. Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torch flame or as small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any ordinary flame does. The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a range of up to 60', causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful hit. The efreet can create another flame, and throw it as well if desired, once per round.\n\nEfreet may assume the form of a column of fire at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; an efreeti in flame-form fights as if it were a fire elemental.\n\nDue to their highly magical nature, efreet cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire attacks."

    "description": "An elemental is a being formed from one of the foundational elements of reality. In Western traditions, the classical elements are air, earth, fire, and water; Asian traditions include a different group: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood. This book presents the full range needed for either tradition, and to those types are added cold and lightning elementals for those who wish to be less traditional. As always, the Game Master decides what sort of monsters appear in their world, and so not all of the following creatures may be encountered.\n\nEach type of elemental may be summoned to the material plane by means of one of three different methods:\n- Conjured by the 5th level Magic-User spell *conjure elemental*; or,\n- Summoned by means of a magical staff; or,\n- Summoned by a device, as given in the Miscellaneous Magic subsection of the Treasure section of this book.\n\nThese three types of elementals are quite reasonably called staff, device, and conjured elementals. The hit dice of an elemental depends on the type, as follows:\n| Type   | Hit Dice |\n|----------|----------|\n| Staff  | 8    |\n| Device  | 12    |\n| Conjured | 16    |\n\nThe summoner of an elemental must concentrate on it to control it, and may take no other action, including attacking, being attacked, or moving, or control will be lost. Once control is lost it cannot be regained, and the uncontrolled elemental will move directly toward the summoner and attack.\n\nElementals must be summoned from a large quantity of the appropriate natural material. For example, air elementals require a large quantity of air (so small underground spaces will not support the summoning of one); earth elementals require access to natural earth or stone (and worked stone such as the stone walls of a castle will not work); fire elementals require a large fire such as a bonfire; and water elementals require access to a substantial body of water, at the very least a river or lake (small streams and artificial pools will not work). Finally, when an elemental is summoned, no other elemental of the same type may be summoned in the same day within a radius of 100 miles of the location.\n\nNon-magical weapons cannot harm an elemental. Attacks made by an elemental should be considered non-magical when determining harm of the elemental."

Ghosts are undead, and as such are immune to **sleep**, **charm**, and **hold magic**.\n\nSeeing a ghost is so terrible that any living creature who does so must save vs. Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds.

Elves and dwarves (and other long-lived creatures such as dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to resist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit. Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. If a ghost is fighting a living creature which does not have a Constitution score, the GM should assign whatever score they see fit.\n\nLike most incorporeal creatures, ghosts may normally be hit only by magical weapons. However, if a ghost makes use of its touch attack, it becomes vulnerable to non-magical weapons until the beginning of the next round of combat.\n\nLost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point per casting of restoration; nothing else (except a wish) can restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a character's Constitution falls to 0, they die permanently and cannot be raised (but still may be reincarnated).\n\nOnce per turn, a ghost can use telekinesis (as the spell) as if it were a 10th level Magic-User.\n\nInstead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess a living creature. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (as if cast by a 10th level Magic-User), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be able to move into the target (so it is possible to avoid this attack by outrunning the ghost). The target can resist the attack with a successful save vs. Spells. A creature that successfully saves is immune to being possessed by that ghost for 24 hours. If the save fails, the ghost enters the target's body and controls it; control may be maintained until the ghost chooses to leave the victim's body, or until it is driven out by means of a remove curse or dispel evil spell.While it is possessing a living creature, a ghost may not use any of its special abilities."

The afflicted humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.\n\nAn afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the knowledge or abilities they possessed in life. The newly-risen ghoul is not under the control of any other ghouls, but hungers for the flesh of the dead and behaves like any other ghoul in all respects.\n\n**Ghasts** look and fight almost exactly like ghouls, but they are smarter and just a bit more powerful.

A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same ghast's stench for 24 hours. A **neutralize poison** spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.\n\nThey may be Turned by Clerics using the same column as the ghoul, but as they are superior to ghouls, in a mixed group of ghasts and ghouls the GM should apply Turning effects to the ordinary ghouls first.\n\nHumanoids bitten by ghasts may be infected with ghast fever.

The afflicted humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.\n\nAn afflicted humanoid who dies of ghast fever rises as a ghast at the next midnight, in a similar fashion to the ghoul. However, a humanoid who becomes a ghast in this way retains all of the knowledge and abilities they possessed in life, unless those abilities are directly incompatible with the creature's new form (as decided by the GM). For such ghasts, the GM should also adjust XP values to include any such abilities. The newly-risen ghast is not under the control of any other ghasts, but hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like any other ghast in all respects."

    "description": "Cloud giants are huge, with males averaging 18 feet tall and females 17 feet tall; an adult cloud giant will normally weigh more than 4,750 pounds. They have very pale skin, sometimes with a slight bluish tint, and their hair is bright metallic colors such as silver, brass, or even gold. They have long lives, with most surviving to 400 years barring disease or misadventure.\n\nCloud giants are often vain, convinced they are the highest form of creation. They wear the finest clothing, make and eat the best food and drink, and live in castles built on high mountains or even in the clouds themselves. Like most giants, they are suspicious of the smaller races, but cloud giants do not usually prey upon them, preferring instead to demand tribute from smaller humanoids living nearby.\n\nDespite being self-centered, they fight in highly trained units that use sound tactics; their belief in their own superiority allows no less. Attacking from above is preferred, and ranged attacks are always considered better than melee. To that end, cloud giants can throw large stones up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage each. Also, 5% of cloud giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 8 (2d4). A favorite tactic is to encircle enemies, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with spells. In battle, cloud giants wear finely crafted, intricately engraved plate mail."

Females are slightly smaller, standing 22 feet tall on the average and weighing around 14,000 pounds. They look very much like enormous, thickly built hill giants, and among humans they are often seen as little more than that. This is underselling the mountain giants, however, for though their crafting is primitive they have an intricately detailed social structure.\n\nMountain giants live in clans, led by the oldest male and female (or by their oldest offspring if the elders choose to delegate leadership due to advanced age). Each clan rules over and controls a group of 1d6 mountain peaks, generally spanning an area with a 5-6 mile diameter. They prefer peaks connected by high ridges so that they do not have to descend too far when walking their territory. Clan members who are mated establish households within the territory; unmarried members typically live with their parents until they are wed. The \"lair\" encounter figures above are for a single household, but if one household is attacked and the attackers subsequently retreat, upon their return they will usually find much of the rest of the clan waiting for them in ambush.\n\nThey wear armor made of wood held together with heavy rope, and wield giant clubs or staves carved from fully grown trees harvested from the lower reaches of their territory. If they live near storm giants, they may trade for better weapons (the second damage rating given above) but usually cannot afford storm giant armor.\n\nA mountain giant can throw large stones up to 240' for 4d6 points of damage each."

    "description": "Golems are a kind of construct, a creature created from non-living matter and animated by application of magic. The powers required to animate a golem are prodigious, and involve summoning, capturing, and binding an elemental spirit to the constructed body. This process also binds the golem to the will of its creator.\n\n They are mindless, and thus immune to magics affecting the mind such as sleep, charm, hold, and any form of mind reading or telepathy. They must be given explicit, detailed instructions verbally, and the controller must be within 60 feet of the golem to do so. If not actively being commanded, a golem will follow the last instructions given to it until the controller returns. If such a golem is attacked, it will fight in its own defense but will usually not pursue the attackers if they flee. The controller can order the golem to follow the commands of another, but can always resume control if desired (i.e. the controller's commands always take precedence).\n\n Employing a golem in combat is tricky, for once one attacks an opponent there is a cumulative 1% chance each round (so 1% the first round, 2% the second, 3% the third, and so on) that the golem will stop following commands and become berserk. Once this happens the golem will attack any creature in range, choosing targets randomly when there are more than one. If all targets are killed or driven away the golem will move on, looking for more creatures to kill and breaking down any barrier that stands in its way if it is at all possible.\n\n The berserk chance for a golem that is still under control is reset to 0% only when the golem is inactive, neither attacking nor being attacked, for one full round.\n\n The creator of the golem (but not any other person who might have been delegated control) may try to calm the golem, speaking firmly to it to convince it to stop. The creator needs to succeed at a saving throw vs. Spells to do this, after spending a round talking to the golem. If this roll fails the golem turns its attention to the creator and pursues them with single-minded hatred.\n\n If a berserk golem is unable to attack anyone for 5 rounds it resumes its inactive state, and the controller can again give it commands. If it begins to pursue its creator, though, it will never stop no matter how long it takes, and must normally be trapped or destroyed to stop it. It has no special way to find the creator, however, and will become inactive if it loses sight of the creator for a minimum of 1 day. If the golem is successfully calmed, it can be given commands again on the very next round of combat.\n\n As their bodies are made of non-living matter, golems can only be hit by magical weapons. Conversely, they are less resistant to various effects due to the fact that they are not living creatures; in general, golems save as if they were Fighters of ½ their hit dice in levels. For example, a Bone Golem has 8 hit dice, but saves as a Fighter of 4th level."

They are bad-tempered and territorial, but not particularly cunning.\n\nThe Armor Class and Hit Dice of a hydra are keyed to the number of heads; specifically, a hydra has a number of Hit Dice exactly equal to the number of heads, and an Armor Class equal to the number of heads plus 11. Note that these statistics do not change if an individual loses heads, as described below.\n\nA hydra may be slain by damage in the normal fashion; however, most who fight them choose to strike at their heads. If a character using a melee weapon chooses to strike at a particular head (i.e. states such intent to the GM) and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will not be able to attack anymore. Such damage also applies to the monster's total hit points, of course.\n\nSome hydras live in the ocean; use the given movement as a swimming rate rather than walking in this case. A very few hydras can breathe fire; those that have this ability can emit a flame 10' wide and 20' long one time per head per day. This attack will be used about one time in three (1-2 on 1d6) if it is available; roll for each head which is attacking. Each such attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs. Dragon Breath reducing the amount by half. Note that the XP value of a fire-breathing hydra should be higher; treat them as if they have a single asterisk (i.e. add the special ability bonus to the base XP for the monster)."

Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three rounds if the character manages to exit the swarm. It is possible to \"ward off\" the insects by swinging a weapon, shield, or other similar-sized object around, and in this case damage is likewise reduced to 1 point per round.\n\nIf a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 points of damage per round. Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm can be affected by a sleep spell. Smoke can be used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from any victims due to smoke, the damage stops immediately).

Non-magical metal attacked by an ironbane, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A non-magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does half damage before being destroyed. Magic weapons or armor lose one \"plus\" each time they make contact with the ironbane; this loss is permanent.\n\nThe metal oxides created by this monster are its food; thus, a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters. Use a morale check to determine this.\n\nMetals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to an ironbane and will be ignored.

Sometimes male lions are rogues, living outside a pride, and in those cases they may hunt as individuals or in pairs.\n\nLions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans. Injured or obviously vulnerable humans may be too much of a temptation though."

Males and females are basically the same size, and it is quite difficult for other races to tell them apart. Due to their great Strength they always receive a +1 to damage done with melee weapons. They wear leather armor and carry shields in battle.\n\nLizard men are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for an extended period of time (up to a full turn). They cannot swim while wearing armor; however, they often hide in the water even while armored, standing on the bottom with just nose and eyes exposed (similar to a crocodile). When they are able to employ this maneuver, lizard men surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.\n\nLizard men are largely indifferent to other races, being primarily interested in their own survival. If aroused, however, they are fearsome warriors, using simple but sound tactics.\n\nSubterranean lizard, also called troglodytes, are superficially very similar to the common variety. Their skin is paler, and their eyes are red and seem to glow in low light conditions. Individuals are shorter than the common variety, standing just 5 to 6 feet tall, due in part to their somewhat \"hunched\" stance. They weigh about as much as the common type.\n\nThese monsters can change color at will, allowing them to blend into underground environments so well that they gain surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6.\n\nFurthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any surprise round due to their excellent ambush skills.\n\nSubterranean lizard men secrete a smelly oil that keeps their scaly skin supple. All mammals (including, of course, all the standard character races) find the scent repulsive, and those within 10 feet of one must make a saving throw versus poison. Those failing the save suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls while they remain within 10 feet of the creature. Getting out of range negates the penalty, but renewed exposure reinstates the penalty without an additional saving throw. The results of the original save last a full 24 hours, after which a new save must be rolled."

An animal form will usually appear larger and stronger than normal animals of the same type, and some say you can see the intelligence of a human in their eyes, if you dare to get close enough. \n\nThis affliction is in fact a kind of magical disease, though it is not susceptible to the cure disease spell. Any human who loses half or more of their hit points due to lycanthrope bite and/or claw attacks will subsequently contract the same form of lycanthropy in 3d6 days. For non-Human characters or creatures, contracting the disease is fatal in the same time period. A cure disease cast before the onset is complete will stop the progress of the disease, but once the time has elapsed, the transformation is permanent. \n\nWhen first infected, most lycanthropes cannot control their changes and will transform when stressed or under some other type-specific circumstances. After around two to three years, they gain the ability to change at will, and may attempt to resist involuntary transformation by means of a saving throw vs. Paralysis. \n\nIn animal or hybrid form lycanthropes may be hit only by silver or magical weapons."

These prehistoric relatives of the elephant are intelligent and able to communicate with each other in a rudimentary way. They are more aggressive than the common elephant and will attack any creature they see as a threat.\n\nThey have the same basic attack modes as mammoths, with the same limitations as given above.\n\nA light load for a mastodon is 8,000 pounds; a heavy load, up to 16,000 pounds.\n\nA mastodon has no treasure as such, but its tusks are worth 1d10 x 100 gp."

If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs. Petrify itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to petrify even after death otherwise.\n\nMedusae instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.\n\nFurther, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save vs. Poison or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not individually, once per round for 1d6 points of damage (plus the poison).\n\nThese creatures are well aware that, from the neck down anyway, they are quite visually pleasing to most humanoid males; they will thus often seek to show off their bodies in clinging clothes while wearing veils, hoods, scarves, and so on to hide their true nature. In this way they hope to get closer to potential victims and more easily surprise them.\n\nMedusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the fact that, once the lair of one is found, any humans living nearby will not rest until she is slain. They are hateful creatures, however, and will seek to destroy as many humans as they can without being discovered."

They accomplish this by means of their enchanting songs.\n\nA mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards, but generally has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect must save vs. Spells to resist, or else they will move toward the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to anything the mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid's temperament.\n\nContrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half fish) and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.\n\nMermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin. This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.\n\nThree-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother.\n\nMermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females. A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a group is called a pod.\n\nA mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the attention of men. Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any pod includes 2d4-2 children or juveniles (over and above the number rolled for Number Appearing). Adventurers generally meet mermaids only in groups of one or two.\n\nMermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers. They hunt fish and harvest kelp for food. Mermaids sometimes possess more than 1 hit die, and about 3% have some Clerical abilities."

A light load for a pegasus is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds."

Those found in desert terrain are generally marked in yellow, red, and brown, while those found underground may be black or white in color (those found in the deepest caverns are always white). Like spiders, they can climb walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or otherwise climb entirely upside down.\n\nA hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck fast and will be drawn to the rhagodessa's mouth on the next round and automatically hit for 2d8 points of damage; this repeats each round, so long as the victim is held. Escaping from the sticky hold requires a successful roll to open doors. If both legs hit, this roll frees the victim from just one of them; a second roll is needed to fully escape, and of course the rhagodessa can simply attack again with the free leg on the next round. Alternately, victims may attack with small or medium melee weapons, and in fact gain a bonus of +2 is added to the attack roll if a small weapon is used. If the giant rhagodessa is slain, any held victim can be freed with the open doors roll mentioned above (and in this case another character can help, making the roll for the victim).\n\nThe rhagodessa seems unable to use its bite attack against a foe it has not captured in this way, and neither will it attack more than one foe with its legs.

Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around 48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet long and have massive wingspans of around 80 feet. A roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. Like most birds, the males have the brighter plumage, with females being duller in color and thus more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be hidden, that is).\n\nA light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest characters can hope to ride upon a normal roc. For a large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1,200. Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3,000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when carrying up to 6,000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off full-grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous birds.\n\nA roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature results in that creature being carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the roc to carry. While being carried, the victim will not be further attacked, so as to be as \"fresh\" as possible when given to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary).\n\nWhen rocs are encountered they are almost certainly hunting, and will generally attack creatures of horse size or less. If facing a large group the rocs may make passes close overhead to scatter them first before each chooses a single target to prey upon. Mated pairs found in their nests will fight to the death to protect their eggs or offspring (morale of 12 in this case)."

One attacks with its antennae, brushing them over metal items. Non-magical metal attacked by a rust monster, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A hit with a non-magical metal weapon inflicts half damage before the weapon is destroyed. Magic weapons or armor permanently lose one \"plus\" each time they make contact with the monster. The metal oxides created by this monster are its food; a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters. Use a morale check to determine this. Metals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to a rust monster and will be ignored. While rust monsters will consume oxides of silver or copper, they have a strong preference for ferrous metals (iron or steel), preferring them over any other metal. Whether the rust monster is in any way related to the rarer ironbane (as found on page 115) is unknown, but both monsters seem to have the exact same power."

Giant crab spiders are horribly enlarged, being around 3' in length. They can change color slowly (over the course of a few days), taking on the overall coloration of their preferred lair or ambush location. After this change is complete, the spider is able to surprise potential prey on 1-4 on 1d6 when in that preferred location. Anyone bitten by a giant crab spider must save vs. Poison or die."

The proboscis has rows of tiny serrated teeth on the inside, and literally turns itself inside out as it carves a way into the victim's body. This causes 1d4 points of damage, and the stirge then proceeds to suck the victim's blood, inflicting an additional 1d4 points of damage each round.\n\nOnce attached, the creature can only be removed by killing it. The victim cannot use weapons larger than a dagger or hand axe to attack the creature, and cannot attack it at all if attacked from behind. Others may attack the creature with a bonus of +2 on the die roll, but any attack that misses hits the victim instead."

They fertilize their soil by entangling, constricting, and killing living creatures, then depositing the bodies in loose soil around the plant's base.\n\nBecause it can lie very still indeed, a strangle vine surprises on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.\n\nStrangle vines are actually mobile, able to uproot themselves and move slowly from place to place; one generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.\n\nEach plant consists of a single long vine of up to 20 feet in length, with many smaller vines 5 feet or so in length packed closely, two vines per foot or thereabouts. The smaller vines are covered in leaves, and in the fall they bear clusters of reddish-purple berries which are tough and bitter but not poisonous.\n\nThere is a similar plant found in underground environments which has leaves the color of iron with pale shiny metallic veins. They grow near geothermal vents or springs, and the rotting flesh that surrounds them often supports mushrooms of various sizes and types. This fungal growth conceals the strangle vine, allowing it to surprise on 1-5 on 1d6 as does the above-ground variety of the plant."

A treant's leaves do not normally fall out in the winter, but as some oaks also retain their leaves into cold weather this may not help in identifying one.\n\nBeing actual trees, treants are big, averaging 25 to 35 feet in height and weighing 4,000 to 5,000 pounds. Their language is difficult for most other races to learn, though Elves are known to have an advantage in mastering it. Many treants know Elvish, and some who live near humans learn Common as well.\n\nTreants are slow to act when potential enemies are nearby, preferring watch them carefully before taking any action. Because of their excellent camouflage treants gain surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.\n\nAll treants have the power to animate other normal trees in their area; up to two trees can be animated at once, but the treant can release one and animate another if needed. Trees to be animated must be within 180 feet of the treant, and must remain within that range or they will return to their normal state. An animated tree requires a full round to uproot itself before it can move around, and then can move at a rate of just 10' per round. Of course, if enemies are within reach the animated tree need not be uprooted.\n\nIf the treant controlling an animated tree is slain or incapacitated, the tree returns to its normal state.\n\nNote that animated trees will automatically root themselves when returning to their normal, dormant state; if such a tree finds itself on stone or some other surface it cannot penetrate, it will move around randomly for 1d6 rounds until it accidentally finds a suitable area, or failing that, until it topples and falls.\n\nAny character or creature nearby when this happens must save vs. Death Ray to scamper away; those who fail will suffer 2d6 points of damage and will be trapped under the fallen tree.

    "description": "Trolls are huge, rangy humanoids with lumpy skin that is a dull grayish green in color. They stand up to 9 feet tall despite having a rather hunched posture, and may weigh as much as 600 pounds. Their skin is rubbery and slightly damp to the touch, and they have long sharp black claws and long sharp white teeth. Trolls have a disconcerting tendency to smile toothily most of the time, as if their brutal lives are the most entertaining thing imaginable.\n\nTrolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit point of damage each round after being injured. A troll reduced to 0 hit points is not dead, but only disabled for 2d6 rounds, at which point it will regain 1 hit point. Note that the troll may \"play dead\" until it has regenerated further. Damage from fire and acid cannot be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a troll can only be killed by this sort of damage. The lower morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll faces attackers armed with fire or acid.\n\nThe regenerative power of trolls is so great that limbs or other body parts (even a head!) can be reattached if severed simply by pressing the severed ends back together for a moment. Trolls in a group will generally help dismembered fellows to reassemble themselves, but only if it's convenient. If the severed part is not restored, a new one will grow in its place in 1d4 turns.\n\nNote that a troll with a new head will not remember its former life, nor will it yet know how to speak; it will behave as would any confused and hostile animal.\n\nTrolls speak a primitive language, and are often fluent in Goblin, Hobgoblin, Orc, Ogre, or Giant depending on which of these species live nearest them. A few (20% or so) speak Common.\n\nTrolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and bloodshed. Though trolls could easily use a variety of weapons, they much prefer the sensation of flesh being rent by their teeth and claws. \n\nA **trollwife** is a female troll; despite the name, there is no requirement that she be married (nor, in fact, do trolls normally engage in formal marriages). A typical adult trollwife stands 11 feet tall and weighs 700 pounds. They have no outward appearance of femininity, at least according to the standards of humans, elves, or even orcs; rather, a trollwife simply looks like an extraordinarily large troll. Like a normal male troll, a trollwife has lumpy skin that is a dull grayish green in color.\n\nTrollwives have all the abilities and weaknesses of the males of the species; in particular, they regenerate exactly as do the males.\n\nWhen encountered, a trollwife may be alone, cohabitating with a male (her \"husband\"), or raising a brood of trollkin. Roll 1d10; on a result of 1, she is living alone; on a roll of 2-3, she is raising her young; on 4 or higher, she is living with a male. If one has a mate or offspring, there is a 1-3 on 1d10 chance she is encountered alone, 4-7 that her mate or young are encountered in her absence, or 8-10 that all are present.\n\nAdd 1 to the trollwife's morale score if she is with her mate, or 2 if she has young present. This means that, unless threatened with fire or acid, a trollwife will fight without checking morale while her offspring are present. If a trollwife's mate or offspring are slain in her absence, she will track the killers unerringly, and upon finding them will attack with the same morale bonus.\n\nTrollwives are solitary with respect to other adult trollwives, for they hate each other with a fierce passion. If forced together they will put aside their enmity until all non-troll enemies are dead (at which point they may well fight over who will eat the choicest of the remains)."

Note that a trollkin won't be encountered having more than 6 hit dice, so if only one individual is indicated by the 1d6 roll but the 2d6 roll totals more than 6, you must increase the number of individuals. The referee should feel free to round the number of hit dice up or down as they see fit, or to allocate them in an approximately equal fashion if desired. Trollkin broods are rolled in this way owing to the fact that bigger or tougher individuals are likely to kill and eat the weaker ones, generally when their mother is out hunting.\n\nRefer to the entry for trolls for details regarding regeneration, morale checks, and so on; except as noted above, trollkins share all these features with the adults."

This horn is in fact a magic weapon with an added attack and damage bonus of +3; if removed from the unicorn or the unicorn dies the horn loses this effect. A unicorn may perform a charging attack with its horn, but it cannot also attack with its hooves in the same round. Most unicorns are white, sometimes with the faintest tinge of lavender, pink, or gold visible in sunlight. Adult male unicorns have beards similar to those of goats. The eyes of a unicorn are almost always a bright, often unlikely color such as gold, sea-blue, deep green, violet, or even a luminous-looking magenta. Adult male unicorns stand an average of 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 1,100 to 1,300 pounds. Females are slightly smaller, generally 4¾ feet at the shoulder with a weight from 950 to 1,200 pounds.\n\nThree times per day a unicorn can cast **cure light wounds** by a touch of its horn. Once per day a unicorn can transport itself 360' (as the spell **dimension door**), and can carry a full load (possibly including a rider) while doing so. A light load for a unicorn is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.\n\nAn alicorn resembles a unicorn in all details, save that they always have yellow, orange or red eyes, and (if one gets close enough to see) pronounced, sharp canine teeth. Alicorns are as evil as unicorns are good, using their razor-sharp horns and clawlike hooves as weapons. They attack weaker creatures for the sheer pleasure of killing, but will try to avoid stronger parties. They may make charging attacks just as unicorns do.\n\nAlicorns cannot heal or transport themselves by magic as unicorns do. However, alicorns may become invisible at will, exactly as if wearing a **Ring of Invisibility**."

Other hobgoblin tribes employ them as bodyguards for the chieftain, and accord them great honor.

    "description": "Vampires are undead monsters. Though they may look just a bit more pale than when they were alive, they do appear to live and even breathe as mortals do. A vampire has all the memories and abilities it had in life, and is effectively immortal. Living forever in the shadows often leads to vampires being decadent, while their hunger for blood makes them cruel.\n\nVampires cast no reflections in silvered mirrors or water, though despite conventional wisdom to the contrary they do reflect in shiny base metals; the innate purity of silver and water simply will not reflect them. A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a save vs. Spells is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2 due to the power of the charm. This charm is so powerful that the victim will not resist being bitten by the vampire.\n\nThe bite inflicts 1d3 points of damage, then each round thereafter one energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire regenerates (i.e. is healed) for up to 1d6 hit points for each energy level drained. If the victim dies from the energy drain, they will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later) and thereafter will be under the complete control of the \"parent\" vampire (but is freed if that vampire is ever destroyed).\n\nIf using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using melee weapons, and thus a vampire will generally choose to use a melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than attempting to bite.\n\nVampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all undead are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.\n\nCreatures of the night obey vampires. Once per day a vampire can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such creatures are nearby). The creatures summoned arrive 2d6 rounds later and will obey the vampire for up to an hour before leaving.\n\nVampires can also transform into the form of these creatures, assuming the shape of a giant bat (page 66), giant rat (page 135), or a dire wolf (page 158) at will. The transformation requires a single round during which the vampire cannot attack. The flying movement given above is for the giant bat form; the vampire can use the attack forms of the animal shape assumed, as given on the indicated pages. The vampire cannot activate any of its other powers while in animal form, but effects already active will remain so.\n\nVampires are powerful indeed, but they do have several specific weaknesses.\n\nFirst, a vampire can be held at bay by several things, including the smell of garlic, a silver or silvered mirror, or a holy symbol presented by a believer (GM's discretion is advised here, but in general someone threatened by a vampire may be more devout than usual). In such a situation the vampire cannot approach within 5 feet of the repellent item or character, nor can it make any melee attacks or otherwise touch those within the warded area.\n\nRunning water (such as a stream or river) acts as a barrier to a vampire; one cannot cross over any such waterway, neither by bridge or by waterway or even by flying. It is possible for a vampire to be carried across while lying in its own coffin with the lid closed; the presence of the water flowing beneath the coffin will force the vampire to remain dormant.\n\nFinally, a vampire may not enter any private dwelling without being invited by someone who resides there, and then only if invited while the resident is actually inside the structure. Public buildings of any sort do not present this problem; even inns are fully accessible to a vampire.\n\nDestroying a vampire is not an easy task. When reduced to zero hit points or less a vampire becomes incapacitated but is not slain (as previously explained). If exposed to direct sunlight, the vampire will be utterly destroyed in a single round if it cannot find a way to escape in that time. Being immersed in running water (as defined above) causes 3d8 points of damage each round, and if reduced to zero or fewer hit points in this way the vampire is destroyed. If the vampire is cremated in a funeral pyre while in any dormant state it will be destroyed.\n\nThe most dramatic method of defeating a vampire is actually the least reliable: driving a wooden stake through its heart. Doing this will instantly reduce the vampire to zero hit points, and it will remain \"dead\" for so long as the stake is present. Removal of the stake, however, allows the vampire to begin regenerating as described above. It is not normally possible to drive a stake through a vampire's heart while it is actively resisting, but this can be done after reducing the monster to zero hit points in the usual way. Of course, after staking a vampire it is possible to use sunlight, running water, or a funeral pyre as described above to complete its destruction."

Further, a wyvern may not bite when flying past an opponent.\n\nThe only situation in which all attacks can be made is when the monster is landing.\n\nIf a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to carry off its victim; victims weighing 300 pounds or less can be carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a victim for at most 6 rounds. While flying with a victim, the wyvern cannot make any further attacks against it, but of course if the victim makes a nuisance of itself (such as by injuring the wyvern), it may be dropped."

    "description": "A Zombraire is a free-willed undead Magic-User. Like the zombie it resembles, a zombraire moves silently, is very strong, and must be literally hacked to pieces to be destroyed. However, it does not suffer the initiative penalty common to ordinary zombies. It takes only half damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical bonus). It may be Turned by a Cleric (as a wight), and is immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells.\n\nA zombraire slowly rots away, and as it does it loses its sanity; this is represented by the variable morale listed. An insane zombraire fights to the death in hopes of being slain, thus ending its tortured existence.\n\nThe given statistics are for a zombraire formed from a 2nd-level Magic-user; the HD and saving throws of a zombraire are based on the level it had in life. A zombraire can cast spells as it did when living, but cannot learn new spells.\n\nA Skeletaire is the final form of a zombraire which has rotted away completely. It takes only half damage from edged weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical bonus). It can be Turned by a Cleric (as a zombie), and is immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. A skeletaire never fails morale, and thus always fights until destroyed.\n\nThe statistics above are for a skeletaire formed from a 2nd-level Magic-user. A skeletaire will have HD equal to the character's level minus 1, and will save as a Magic-user of the level equal to its HD. The skeletaire cannot speak, but still retains the ability to prepare and cast spells as it did in life (but like a zombraire, it cannot learn new spells).\n\nThe process of creating or becoming a zombraire are variable, and often involve cursed magic items (especially cursed scrolls)."
