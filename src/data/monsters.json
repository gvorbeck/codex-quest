    "description": "Giant ants are fantastically enlarged versions of the more common variety of ants. Normal workers are 5 to 6 feet long; queens are larger, growing up to 9 feet in length. Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical difference between them. Though relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death. They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair. \n\nGiant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets. \n\nLarge and huge ants are similar to giant ants in all ways except for size; large ants are 1 to 2 feet long, while huge ants are 3 to 4 feet in length. Though smaller, their colonies have more members, and so their lair treasures are of similar size to those found in the lairs of giant ants."

    "description": "The statistics above represent the swifter sorts of wild herd animals, including deer (1 hit die, usually), antelope (2 hit dice), elk (3 hit dice), and moose (4 hit dice). They are skittish and will flee if provoked, but males are more aggressive in the presence of females (use the parenthesized morale in this case).\n\nCattle, aurochs, and bison are not included in this category but rather can be found on page 72. Generally, a hit die herd animals inflict 1d4 points of damage on a hit, 2 and 3 hit die animals inflict 1d6, and 4 hit die animals inflict 1d8. The GM should feel free to vary from these figures as he or she sees fit; there are many types of herd animals in the world, and some are better armed than others."
