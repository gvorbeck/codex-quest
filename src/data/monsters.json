    "description": "Giant ants are fantastically enlarged versions of the more common variety of ants. Normal workers are 5 to 6 feet long; queens are larger, growing up to 9 feet in length. Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical difference between them. Though relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death. They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair. \n\nGiant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets. \n\nLarge and huge ants are similar to giant ants in all ways except for size; large ants are 1 to 2 feet long, while huge ants are 3 to 4 feet in length. Though smaller, their colonies have more members, and so their lair treasures are of similar size to those found in the lairs of giant ants."

They are pack hunters by nature, but when encountered singly or in small groups pose shyly when their numbers are overwhelming. Use the higher morale figure when a barkling group outnumbers their enemies by 3 combatants to 1 or more.\n\nBarklings can deliver a nasty bite but prefer to fight with weapons, favoring small weapons made for their stature and relative lack of strength; all such  weapons do 1d4 points of damage on a hit.\n\nBarklings see well in the dark, having Darkvision with a range of 30 feet, but their sense of smell is where they excel; a barkling can track almost any living or corporeal undead creature by scent, even if it has been as much as a day since it passed.\n\nIn combat barklings usually wear chainmail armor which they craft themselves (as shown in the Armor Class given above).\n\nOne out of every ten barklings will be a warrior with 1 hit die (25 XP). In barkling encampments, one out of every twenty will be a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In villages of 50 or more  there will be a barkling lord of 3 hit dice (145 XP) who has +1 bonus to damage. Barklings gain a +1 bonus to  their morale as long as they are led by any of their leaders.\n\nIn addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a wizard being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a chieftain is present). A wizard is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior barkling statistically, but has Magic-User abilities at level 1d4+1. For XP purposes, treat the wizard barkling as if it has a number of hit dice equal to its magic-user level -1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.\n\nBarklings are sometimes confused with kobolds, for whom they have a particular hatred; calling a barkling a kobold or suggesting that the two species are related is considered a terrible insult."

    "description": "A basilisk is a giant six-legged lizard-like monster that petrifies living creatures with its gaze. A basilisk has dark brown, green, or black skin on its back and a pale yellow or white belly. Adults reach a body length of 5 to 7 feet with a tail of roughly equal length, and a weight of 250 to 400 pounds. There is no particular difference in size between males and females.\n\nAny living creature meeting the gaze of a basilisk must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone instantly. In general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror it may see its reflection.\n\nThe greater basilisk appears identical to the common variety, save that it is larger, having a body length of about 8 feet with a 7 to 9 foot long tail and weighing between 400 and 750 pounds. The skin of the greater basilisk is toxic to the touch, such that any living creature bitten by one or who touches one with bare skin must save vs. Poison or die. This effect persists even after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20 hours; the only way to tell if the effect has subsided is to touch the corpse, an obviously bad idea."

Their carapaces tend to be dark brown with lighter brown striped or spotted patterns, but there are many variations.\n\nThey are fast runners, depending on their speed to run down prey, and they willingly prey on any creature of man size or smaller. Like most beetles, they have more or less the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind."

    "description": "Blink dogs, also known as flicker beasts, are strange creatures which resemble wolves or hyenas who can teleport up to 120 feet at will. Teleportation is so easy for them that they can sometimes teleport away before being attacked. When one knows of the attacker's presence, it is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray, and on a successful roll teleports 1d6 x 10 feet in a random direction (but never into solid matter, nor into any dangerous area the creature knows about). \n\nThese creatures are pack hunters, using their teleportation to confuse their prey until they are able to surround it. In this way, some members of the pack will be able to attack from behind, a trick they are so good at that they receive the same benefits as a thief: +4 to hit and double damage if the hit is successful.\n\nBlink dogs are large canines, typically light brown in color with short bristly hair; some varieties are striped or spotted. They communicate using a language of barks, growls, and yips which is somewhat limited but can convey useful tactical information. They are shy, generally avoiding a fight if possible, but they hate deceivers and will generally attack them on sight."

    "description": "Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are actually animated plants, dismally aware of their surroundings. These plants are always in bloom, bearing beautiful flowers that are normally white (or rarely, yellow) in color.\n\nThe fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30' from the plant in ideal conditions. Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal conditions. Living creatures who smell the fragrance must save vs. Poison or become befuddled; such a victim will drop anything carried and try to approach the plant. Each round an unaffected living creature can smell the fragrance it must make this save. Befuddled creatures will not resist the attacks of the blood rose; if affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect of the fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later. Undead monsters, constructs, etc. are not affected.\n\nEach blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whip-like canes studded with thorns with which it can attack. When a cane hits, it wraps around the victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round. A blood rose which has recently (within one day) \"eaten\" in this way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep wine red in color, which will fade slowly back to white or yellow as the plant digests the blood it has consumed."

They are wild and cruel, and bully smaller humanoids whenever possible.\n\nBugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant. They are able to move on nearly complete silence, surprising opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. In order to remain silent, they must wear only leather or hide armor, as indicated in the Armor Class scores above. Bugbears receive a +1 bonus on damage due to their great Strength. As with most goblinoid monsters, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.\n\nOne out of every eight bugbears will be a hardened warrior of 4+4 Hit Dice (240 XP), with a +2 bonus to damage. In lairs of 16 or more bugbears, there will be a chieftain of 6+6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with a +3 bonus to damage. Bugbears gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a hardened warrior or chieftain. In the lair, bugbears never fail a morale check as long as the chieftain is alive. In addition, there is a 2 in 6 chance that a shaman will be present in a lair. A shaman is equal to an ordinary bugbear statistically, but possesses 1d4+1 levels of Clerical abilities."

    "description": "Caecilia are carnivorous, legless amphibians; they strongly resemble earthworms, but they have bony skeletons and sharp teeth. Caecilia live entirely underground. The giant variety can grow up to 30' long and frequently are found in caverns or dungeons. They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very sensitive to sound and vibrations, and are able to find their prey regardless of light or the absence thereof.\n\nA giant caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid (such as a goblin or halfling) whole. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, such a victim is swallowed whole (assuming that roll does actually hit the victim). A swallowed victim suffers 1d8 damage per round, and may only attack from the inside with a small cutting or stabbing weapon such as a dagger. While the inside of the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit, fighting while swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to the attack roll are applied.\n\nOnce a caecilia has swallowed an opponent, it will generally attempt to disengage from combat, going to its lair to rest and digest its meal."
