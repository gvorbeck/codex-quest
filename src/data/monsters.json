    "description": "Giant ants are fantastically enlarged versions of the more common variety of ants. Normal workers are 5 to 6 feet long; queens are larger, growing up to 9 feet in length. Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical difference between them. Though relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death. They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair. \n\nGiant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets. \n\nLarge and huge ants are similar to giant ants in all ways except for size; large ants are 1 to 2 feet long, while huge ants are 3 to 4 feet in length. Though smaller, their colonies have more members, and so their lair treasures are of similar size to those found in the lairs of giant ants."

They are pack hunters by nature, but when encountered singly or in small groups pose shyly when their numbers are overwhelming. Use the higher morale figure when a barkling group outnumbers their enemies by 3 combatants to 1 or more.\n\nBarklings can deliver a nasty bite but prefer to fight with weapons, favoring small weapons made for their stature and relative lack of strength; all such  weapons do 1d4 points of damage on a hit.\n\nBarklings see well in the dark, having Darkvision with a range of 30 feet, but their sense of smell is where they excel; a barkling can track almost any living or corporeal undead creature by scent, even if it has been as much as a day since it passed.\n\nIn combat barklings usually wear chainmail armor which they craft themselves (as shown in the Armor Class given above).\n\nOne out of every ten barklings will be a warrior with 1 hit die (25 XP). In barkling encampments, one out of every twenty will be a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In villages of 50 or more  there will be a barkling lord of 3 hit dice (145 XP) who has +1 bonus to damage. Barklings gain a +1 bonus to  their morale as long as they are led by any of their leaders.\n\nIn addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a wizard being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a chieftain is present). A wizard is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior barkling statistically, but has Magic-User abilities at level 1d4+1. For XP purposes, treat the wizard barkling as if it has a number of hit dice equal to its magic-user level -1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.\n\nBarklings are sometimes confused with kobolds, for whom they have a particular hatred; calling a barkling a kobold or suggesting that the two species are related is considered a terrible insult."

    "description": "A basilisk is a giant six-legged lizard-like monster that petrifies living creatures with its gaze. A basilisk has dark brown, green, or black skin on its back and a pale yellow or white belly. Adults reach a body length of 5 to 7 feet with a tail of roughly equal length, and a weight of 250 to 400 pounds. There is no particular difference in size between males and females.\n\nAny living creature meeting the gaze of a basilisk must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone instantly. In general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror it may see its reflection.\n\nThe greater basilisk appears identical to the common variety, save that it is larger, having a body length of about 8 feet with a 7 to 9 foot long tail and weighing between 400 and 750 pounds. The skin of the greater basilisk is toxic to the touch, such that any living creature bitten by one or who touches one with bare skin must save vs. Poison or die. This effect persists even after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20 hours; the only way to tell if the effect has subsided is to touch the corpse, an obviously bad idea."

When one knows of the attacker's presence, it is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray, and on a successful roll teleports 1d6 x 10 feet in a random direction (but never into solid matter, nor into any dangerous area the creature knows about). \n\nThese creatures are pack hunters, using their teleportation to confuse their prey until they are able to surround it. In this way, some members of the pack will be able to attack from behind, a trick they are so good at that they receive the same benefits as a thief: +4 to hit and double damage if the hit is successful.\n\nBlink dogs are large canines, typically light brown in color with short bristly hair; some varieties are striped or spotted. They communicate using a language of barks, growls, and yips which is somewhat limited but can convey useful tactical information. They are shy, generally avoiding a fight if possible, but they hate deceivers and will generally attack them on sight."

Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal conditions.

    "description": "Cattle are large mammals with cloven hooves and horned heads. Cattle are raised mostly for their meat (beef), leather, and milk. Cattle eat grass and are fairly gentle unless spooked, in which case they will stampede (run in a group). Anyone caught in the path of the stampede will suffer at least one trampling attack, as determined by the GM. Male cattle are called bulls, females are cows, and young are calves (calf is singular). If attacked, cattle will charge, generally using their horns to attack. Bulls are larger (+1 hit die), less easily frightened (use the second listed morale figure), and are quite aggressive in defense of the herd. A bull will likely attack if he sees quick movements from creatures he might be able to reach with a charge. Meanwhile, if unable to flee cows will usually assume a roughly circular formation with their heads outward, while calves will be kept in the center, though if the opponents are small enough they may instead charge en masse, trampling all creatures in their path.\n\nA typical small farm with cattle will have a bull, 5d4 cows, and 2d10 calves (but not more than the number of cows).\n\nAurochs are wild cattle; they are shaggy and rough-looking. Bison are the largest species of wild bovines. All types of bovines tend to behave in the same general way, as described above.\n\nAn ox is typically a castrated bull used as a draft animal; females may be used, rarely, but males are preferred due to their greater size and strength. Oxen are usually paired as a team to pull a fully-loaded wagon (or the equivalent of 3,000 lb). Oxen require less food and water, being able to eat rough grasses better than draft horses, which makes them valuable to merchants with large caravans going over semi-arid prairie."

The GM should roll a wandering monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.\n\nAny giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent) will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit. This does not interrupt the monster's shrieking.\n\nA giant cave locust can leap up to 60' horizontally, or up to 30' up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from the impact.\n\nFinally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its digestive juices) up to 10' away. Each giant cave locust can perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell."

    "description": "Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish \"true\" dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven\"age categories,\" ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons. \n\nIf one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are  encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of \n\n12 in combat since they are protecting their young. In combat dragons use a powerful bite, slashing claws, a long, whiplike tail, and most famously some form of breath weapon. Tactically, dragons prefer to fight whileflying, making passes over ground-based enemies to strike or breathe on them. Smarter and older dragons will look for the toughest or most dangerous foe to strike down first, particularly preferring to eliminate magic-users as early in a fight as possible. \n\nEach dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail in the same round. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them. \n\nThe breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it. \n\nThere are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a \"normal\" shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon can produce all three shapes. \n\nThe shapes are: \n\n**Cone Shaped**: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age). \n\n**Line Shaped**: The breath weapon is 5' wide (regardless of the given width figure) and extends the given length in a straight line. \n\n**Cloud Shaped**: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, any length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high. \n\nAll dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of \"talking;\" this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or some other humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for \"talking\" is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak. \n\nSome dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately. \n\nAll dragons crave wealth, hoarding as many coins, gems, items of jewelry, and best of all magic items in their lair as possible. The greater a dragon's hoard, the less it will seek to leave its lair, though of course it must hunt for food from time to time. Dragons rarely trust any other creature to defend their hoard, though some will entice aggressive but unintelligent creatures to live nearby in the hopes that they will kill and eat any thieves who might come nosing around. \n\nUnlike other monsters, multiple dragons encountered in a lair together do not share treasure; generate a full treasure for each dragon individually. Treasure for dragons is special, as noted on the table on page 163. The odds of monetary treasure increase with the monster's age category, while the chances of gems, jewelry, and magic items are based upon its hit dice. \n\nYoung dragons typically have brightly colored, glossy skin; as a dragon ages, both the color and the sheen slowly become dull. \n\n**Experience Points (XP)** given for dragons on the following pages are for non-spell-casting dragons of age category 4. The GM must calculate the XP award for any specific dragon as given on page 49, adding a special ability bonus (i.e. a \"star\") if the dragon casts spells."

They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a desert dragon will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with that person as a cat plays with a mouse.\n\nDesert dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only half damage from magical lightning.\n\n| Age Cat. | Hit Dice | Attack Bonus | Breath Weapon | L | W | Talk % | Spells by Level |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 6 | +7 | Lightning (Line) | 80' | - | 0% | - - - - - - |\n| 2 | 7 | +8 | Lightning (Line) | 90' | - | 15% | 1 - - - - - |\n| 3 | 8 | +9 | Lightning (Line) | 100' | - | 20% | 2 1 - - - - |\n| 4            | 9        | +9           | Lightning (Line) | 110'   | -     | 40%            | 3 2 - - - -      |\n| 5            | 10       | +10          | Lightning (Line) | 120'   | 55'   | 50%            | 4 2 1 - - -      |\n| 6            | 11       | +10          | Lightning (Line) | 110'   | 60'   | 60%            | 4 2 1 - - -      |\n| 7            | 12       | +11          | Lightning (Line) | 120'   | 60'   | 70%            | 4 3 2 1 - -      |"

    "description": "Forest dragons are bright leaf green in color, with a tan underbelly. They have long sinuous bodies and move with catlike grace. They are cruel monsters, but they are renowned for their curiosity. They especially like to question adventurers to learn more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby. Adventurers may be allowed to live so long as they remain interesting... but woe to them when the dragon becomes bored.\n\nForest dragons are immune to all poisons. Note that, despite their breath weapon being described as 'poison gas,' damage done by it is exactly the same as with other dragons. More specifically, those in the area of effect do not have to 'save or die' as with ordinary poison, but rather save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage.\n\n| Age Cat. | Hit Dice | Attack Bonus | Breath Weapon | L | W | Talk % | Spells by Level  |\n|--------------|----------|--------------|---------------|--------|-------|----------------|------------------|\n| 1            | 5        | +5           | Gas (Cloud)    | 70'    | 25'   | 0%             | - - - - - -      |\n| 2            | 6        | +6           | Gas (Cloud)    | 80'    | 30'   | 15%            | 1 - - - - -      |\n| 3            | 7        | +7           | Gas (Cloud)    | 90'    | 40'   | 20%            | 2 1 - - - -      |\n| 4            | 8        | +8           | Gas (Cloud)    | 95'    | 45'   | 30%            | 3 2 1 - - -      |\n| 5            | 9        | +9           | Gas (Cloud)    | 100'   | 50'   | 45%            | 4 2 1 - - -      |\n| 6            | 10       | +9           | Gas (Cloud)    | 105'   | 55'   | 55%            | 4 3 2 1 - -      |\n| 7            | 11       | +10          | Gas (Cloud)    | 110'   | 55'   | 65%            | 4 3 2 1 - -      |"

As one ages and its colors dull, this ability improves; when lying in wait, they gain surprise on 1-3 on 1d6 at age categories 2 and 3, on 1-4 in age categories 4 through 6, and on 1-5 at age category 7.\n\nThe breath weapon of the plains dragon is a scorching, shimmering cone of heat, barely visible to the naked eye; at night, however, a glow like steel being forged can be seen streaming from the dragon's open mouth.\n\n**Plains Dragon Age Table**\n| Age Cat. | Hit Dice | Attack Bonus | Breath Weapon | L    | W    | Talk % | Spells by Level  |\n |----------|----------|--------------|---------------|------|------|--------|-----------------|\n | 1        | 2        | +2           | Heat (Cone)   | -    | -    | 0%     | - - - |\n | 2        | 3        | +3           | Heat (Cone)   | 50'  | 25'  | 10%    | 1 - - |\n | 3        | 4        | +4           | Heat (Cone)   | 60'  | 30'  | 15%    | 2 - - |\n | 4        | 5        | +5           | Heat (Cone)   | 70'  | 35'  | 20%    | 3 - - |\n | 5        | 6        | +6           | Heat (Cone)   | 80'  | 40'  | 30%    | 3 1 - |\n | 6        | 7        | +7           | Heat (Cone)   | 85'  | 45'  | 40%    | 3 2 - |\n | 7        | 8        | +8           | Heat (Cone)   | 90'  | 50'  | 50%    | 3 3 1 |\n"

The breath weapon of a sea dragon is a cloud of steam; they are immune to damage from non-magical steam (including the breath weapon of another sea dragon), and suffer only half damage from magical steam attacks.\n\nSea dragons are neutral in outlook, in much the same way as ice dragons.

A dryad lives as long as her tree, and dies when the tree dies; likewise, if the dryad is killed, her tree dies also.\n\nA dryad resembles an elf woman, with skin that resembles fine polished wood or smooth bark and hair like leaves; the hair color of a dryad usually changes with the seasons, being brown in the winter, pale green in the spring, darker green in the summer, and yellow, orange, or red in the fall.\n\nThough they are usually content to live alone, dryads are often friends with creatures such as treant or other nature spirits who might live nearby. Once per day a dryad can cast a charm similar to the spell charm person, and one may choose to use this ability to compel an interesting human or elf to remain with her as a companion for a period of up to a year. The companion can be taken into and brought out of the dryad's tree so long as the charm is still in effect."

These birds have heavy talons and large beaks with a sharp hooked end. Eagles are known to carry prey up to 15 lbs. An eagle will also kill and start to eat animals that are 5 times the eagle's size, up to 80 lbs. Fish-eating eagles are usually the largest varieties, while other types hunt small animals such as rodents or snakes. Coloring is dependent on the species of eagle, and should be chosen by the GM; various brown, gray, black, or white markings are most common, though solid darker colors are sometimes seen. The beaks may range from bright yellowish orange to black. Eagles will dive at a prey and attack with both sets of talons, then attack with the beak."

They are intelligent creatures, and many speak Common or another language common in their home territory.\n\nIndividual giant eagles are rarely encountered alone, as they prefer to live in loose communities. However, when they hunt they do so in a solitary fashion, with each eagle choosing a single creature as prey. As they can communicate with each other, it is extremely rare for two of them to make the mistake of attacking the same prey; in fact, it is not uncommon for one to attack alone to scatter a group of prey so they can each more easily choose a victim.\n\nGiant eagles mate for life. If a nest with eggs or hatchlings is threatened, both parents will fight without checking morale, and other giant eagles in their community may come to their defense but will still seek to scatter any opponents so as to attack them one on one."

They are large beings, 11 to 12 feet in height and weighing around 2,000 pounds, though their weight is generally immaterial due to their ability to fly by magical means.\n\nNote that the 12 morale reflects an efreeti's absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use the \"9\" figure to determine whether an outmatched efreeti decides to leave a combat.\n\nEfreet have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): become **invisible**, with unlimited uses per day; assume **gaseous form**, as the potion, up to one hour per day; **create illusions**, as the spell **phantasmal force** but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day; **create flame**, with unlimited uses; and create a **wall of fire** (as the spell), once per day. Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torch flame or as small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any ordinary flame does. The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a range of up to 60', causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful hit. The efreet can create another flame, and throw it as well if desired, once per round.\n\nEfreet may assume the form of a column of fire at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; an efreeti in flame-form fights as if it were a fire elemental.\n\nDue to their highly magical nature,  efreet cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire attacks."

    "description": "An elemental is a being formed from one of the foundational elements of reality. In Western traditions, the classical elements are air, earth, fire, and water; Asian traditions include a different group: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood. This book presents the full range needed for either tradition, and to those types are added cold and lightning elementals for those who wish to be less traditional. As always, the Game Master decides what sort of monsters appear in their world, and so not all of the following creatures may be encountered.\n\nEach type of elemental may be summoned to the material plane by means of one of three different methods:\n- Conjured by the 5th level Magic-User spell *conjure elemental*; or,\n- Summoned by means of a magical staff; or,\n- Summoned by a device, as given in the Miscellaneous Magic subsection of the Treasure section of this book.\n\nThese three types of elementals are quite reasonably called staff, device, and conjured elementals. The hit dice of an elemental depends on the type, as follows:\n| Type     | Hit Dice |\n|----------|----------|\n| Staff    | 8        |\n| Device   | 12       |\n| Conjured | 16       |\n\nThe summoner of an elemental must concentrate on it to control it, and may take no other action, including attacking, being attacked, or moving, or control will be lost. Once control is lost it cannot be regained, and the uncontrolled elemental will move directly toward the summoner and attack.\n\nElementals must be summoned from a large quantity of the appropriate natural material. For example, air elementals require a large quantity of air (so small underground spaces will not support the summoning of one); earth elementals require access to natural earth or stone (and worked stone such as the stone walls of a castle will not work); fire elementals require a large fire such as a bonfire; and water elementals require access to a substantial body of water, at the very least a river or lake (small streams and artificial pools will not work). Finally, when an elemental is summoned, no other elemental of the same type may be summoned in the same day within a radius of 100 miles of the location.\n\nNon-magical weapons cannot harm an elemental. Attacks made by an elemental should be considered non-magical when determining harm of the elemental."
