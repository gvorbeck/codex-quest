# Display Utils Functions Reference

This file documents all functions in `displayUtils.ts` with simple explanations and return values.

## **displayValue**
- **What it does**: Shows a value or a fallback (like "â€”") if the value is empty/undefined
- **Returns**: A text string with either the value or the fallback

## Notes
- Extremely simple utility with just one function
- Could easily be replaced with inline code or a simple || operator
- Very minimal utility that might not need its own file
