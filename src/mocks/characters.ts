          'This spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, and possibly extraplanar creatures of evil nature. Normal characters, even "bad" characters, cannot be detected by this spell, as only overwhelming evil is detectable. The caster sees the "evil" creatures or objects with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else.\n\nThe exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide. Note that items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not "evil," and thus not detectable by this spell.\n\nReversed, this spell becomes detect good, which works just as described above with respect to detecting "good" enchantments, angelic creatures, and so on.',

          "This spell places a simple form of programmed illusion on a non-living object within range. When triggered, the spell causes the illusion of a mouth to appear on the object and a message to be said aloud. The enchantment can remain in place indefinitely, but is expended when triggered (i.e. the message is normally delivered only once).\n\nThe message recounted may be up to three words per caster level in length. The caster may insert pauses in the message, but the entire message must be delivered in a time period of no more than a turn. The voice of the spell can be made to speak at any volume attainable by a normal human. It will sound enough like the caster's own voice to be recognized by a close associate of the caster, but not identical.\n\nThe illusionary mouth moves as if actually speaking the message being delivered, and remains visible during pauses. If placed on an artistic depiction of a creature with a mouth (such as a painting or statue), the spell can be made to appear to animate the mouth of the object.\n\nThis spell cannot be used to activate magic items which have command words, nor to activate any other magical effects.\n\nThe caster must choose the conditions under which this spell is triggered. The conditions may be as complicated or simple as desired, but must depend only on sight and hearing; the spell has no other sensory capabilities. The spell also has no particular intelligence, and can be fooled by disguises or illusions. The spell does have the capability to effectively see in normal darkness, but not in any sort of magical darkness, and it cannot detect invisible creatures nor see through doors, walls, or even opaque curtains. Likewise, stealth or magical silence are effective in preventing audible triggers. Finally, the spell cannot detect a character's class, level, ability scores, or any other feature not obvious to a normal NPC.\n\nTriggers have an effective sensory range of 10 feet per caster level; sounds, sights, or actions outside that range will never trigger the spell.",
